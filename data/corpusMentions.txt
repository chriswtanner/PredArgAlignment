<start> our view of the advanced micro devices / ati technologies deal is that it 's the last major **[ move ]** amd needed to make to match intel 's breadth in the processor market ( now that intel has shed its communications processor business ) . <end>

<start> `` you wo n't see it tomorrow , but the **[ merger ]** will potentially put amd on a more equal footing with intel , '' said michelle warren , an analyst with evans research in toronto . <end> 

<start> another canadian analyst noted that the **[ merger ]** was likely to bring significant benefits to both companies . <end> 

<start> analysts also said the **[ merger ]** would cause a reshuffle in the global pc industry , affecting chip foundries - including tsmc - that manufacture intel-based graphics chips for ati on an original equipment manufacturing basis . <end> 

<start> in a news conference announcing the **[ merger ]** held in taipei yesterday , henri richard , executive vice president of amd , urged investors not to worry as ati 's relations with tsmc and its rival united microelectronics corp. would not change . <end> 

<start> some analysts however expressed the concern that the **[ merger ]** would impact tsmc in the long run , as loss of ati orders would cause tsmc to see its capacity utilization lowered by 20 to 30 percent . <end> 

<start> the **[ merger ]** , meanwhile , is also expected to create an impact on taiwan 's chipset manufacturers . <end> 

<start> though the exact contours of the **[ merger ]** and its implications in india are not known , both are expected to maintain their existing portfolios of operations as both concentrate on different segments . <end> 

<start> the amd statement said , `` we can not speculate on the implications of the **[ merger ]** for another 90-120 days , till the time integration is complete . '' <end> 

<start> even though the **[ takeover ]** looks fairly valued , rbc analyst steve arthur said there is limited upside to the offer unless competing bids are made for ati . <end>

<start> industry sources have confirmed to eweek that hewlett-packard will **[ acquire ]** electronic data systems for about $ 13 billion . <end> 

<start> it 's too early to tell what impact - if any - hewlett-packard co. 's decision to **[ acquire ]** electronic data systems corp. will have on eds ' operations in south charleston , an eds spokesman said . <end> 

<start> bill ritz , eds spokesman , pointed out that hewlett-packard 's **[ acquisition ]** of eds still needs the approval of regulators and eds ' stockholders . <end> 

<start> hewlett-packard 's ceo says he believes the eds **[ acquisition ]** will make the company 's service offerings stronger . <end> 

<start> hewlett-packard ceo mark hurd believes that the $ 13 billion **[ acquisition ]** of electronic data systems will help build out hp 's enterprise services offerings and `` accelerate '' the company 's reach into new accounts , he said . <end> 

<start> in a may 20 conference call with reporters to announce hp 's 2008 second-quarter financial earnings , hurd offered his thoughts on the upcoming **[ acquisition ]** of eds . <end> 

<start> hurd implied that hp will streamline costs to make the **[ acquisition ]** profitable for shareholders as soon as possible . <end> 

<start> several analysts have said they believe that hp , through its **[ acquisition ]** of eds and other companies , is looking to build a services division that will create an all-in-one shop for building state-of-the art data centers . <end> 

<start> at least initially , sturm said , there will be little noticeable impact on customers from the **[ deal ]** . <end> 

<start> the all-cash **[ deal ]** , announced tuesday , represents hp 's biggest gamble under the leadership of mark hurd , who was hired as chief executive in march 2005 to turn around the maker of personal computers and printers . <end> 

<start> hp estimates that the **[ deal ]** , when completed , will give it about 7 percent of the technology services market , compared with ibm 's 10 percent share . <end> 

<start> `` it appears to be a very daunting **[ deal ]** , '' said american technology research analyst shaw wu . <end> 

<start> industry analysts contacted by eweek generally say they believe that hewlett-packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion acquisition of electronic data systems ? announced officially on may 13 is a good **[ move ]** for both companies , although there will be the usual integration snafus over vendor neutrality issues , business lines , culture shock and layoffs . <end> 

<start> with its second-largest deal , computer giant hopes to **[ grab ]** bigger share of the $ 550 billion technology-services market <end> 

<start> for high-end enterprise it services before this **[ merger ]** , the market consisted of ibm and everybody else . <end> 

<start> the repercussions from the **[ merger ]** of electronic data systems ( eds quote - cramer on eds - stock picks ) with hewlett-packard ( hpq quote - cramer on hpq - stock picks ) will ripple broadly throughout the tech industry . <end> 

<start> and the **[ merger ]** could throw a wrench into eds 's agility alliance , a group of vendors that regularly coordinate to supply hardware , networking , software and services to eds 's outsourcing clients . <end> 

<start> overall , my take is that this **[ transaction ]** sounds great in theory , but there many potential pitfalls . <end> 

<start> **[ acquiring ]** eds also could yield more government work for hp , which had about $ 500 million in prime federal contracts in fiscal 2007 . <end>
