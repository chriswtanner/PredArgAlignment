<start> peter capaldi as 'doctor who' : a return to distinguished tradition ? <end> <start> aug . 05 , 2013 | 2 : 47 p . m . <end> <start> and as the world ( or one obsessed subset thereof ) watched , the name of the person to play the twelfth doctor - though not , of course , the name of the doctor , which shall remain unspoken - was revealed . <end> <start> peter capaldi , the bookmakers' choice by a wide margin , will take over for the retiring matt smith , the doctor since 2010 . <end> <start> smith's doctor will regenerate into capaldi's - same character , just a different body - this christmas . <end> <start> the new star of "doctor who" is best known to americans , which is not to say well known , as the f - bombing spin doctor in armando iannucci's political comedies "the thick of it" ( bbc series ) and "in the loop" ( film spinoff ) and , reaching back through the foggy mists of time , for bill forsyth's gentle comedy of scotland , "local hero . " <end> <start> he is , at any rate , better known to us than were his immediate predecessors , christopher eccleston , david tennant and smith , when they assumed the role . <end> <start> he has twice appeared in the whoniverse , as a first - century businessman in "the fires of pompeii" and a tragic figure at the center of the spun - off "torchwood" miniseries , "children of earth . " <end> <start> he also appears in "world war z" as a world health organization , or who , doctor . <end> <start> you felt a little chill then , didn't you ? <end> <start> the announcement came sunday , after months of public speculation and wish - listing , conspiratorial sifting of coincidence and readings of tea leaves , near the end of "doctor who live : the next doctor , " a bbc special that aired here simultaneously on bbc america . <end> <start> it is not to be confused with the big 50th anniversary special set for november . <end> <start> with fifth doctor peter davison ( the cricket - sweater doctor ) and elderly companion bernard cribbens as its main in - studio star power and a floating tardis ( police - box shaped time machine , for the uninitiated ) introduced as a "special guest , " it was , global interest aside , a small - scale , essentially local , even provincial , event . <end> <start> because whatever else the new doctor would turn out to be - and , if recent history was any guide he would turn out to be tall , thin , white , clean - shaven , not bald and unconventionally attractive ( check , check , check , check , check and check ) - it was going to be somebody british . <end> <start> as does james bond , "doctor who" posits a world in which the u . k . is still at the center of things . <end> <start> it's where the aliens arrive , and the earth is repeatedly saved . <end> <start> some had hoped for a black doctor ( idris elba was often named ) , or a female doctor ( olivia colman , perhaps ) , and as with other great and important offices , it does seem only right that it be open to anyone , regardless of gender or color . <end> <start> indeed , if it seemed just possible this time , it's hard to believe the next doctor won't break one of those lines , or both . <end> <start> that capaldi is an award - winning actor of great reputation does not necessarily mean that it will be any easier for him to take control of the tardis . <end> <start> every new doctor represents a testing of the brand and a testing of the faithful ; there are viewers still mourning the loss of david tennant ( no . 10 ) , and undoubtedly some who feel nothing's been as good since tom baker ( no . 4 ) quit , back in 1981 . <end> <start> it is also , and not incidentally , a test of the show runner , steven moffat , who came in with smith , following series - rebooter russell t davies . <end> <start> show runners are a thing we know about now ; we know whom to blame , and moffat draws a fair share . <end> <start> still , first reactions seem on the whole approving , though some younger online commenters bemoaned capaldi's age - 55 , the age of william hartnell when he created the role , back in 1963 . <end> <start> fangirls who crushed on the younger eccleston , tennant and / or smith wondered how they would adapt to a doctor old enough to be their dad . <end> <start> there is , of course , plenty of precedent for gray - haired swashbucklers ( your gandalf , actually called gray , your obi - wan kenobi , your very vibrant third doctor , john pertwee ) . <end> <start> and moffat can always create companions for raw youth appeal , as was the original custom . <end> <start> ( hartnell's doctor traveled with a granddaughter . ) <end> <start> certainly , capaldi represents a change from matt smith - thought by some to be too young for the part when he took over , ironically - but he also offers a range of new tonal possibilities , some of which are also old possibilities . <end> <start> moffat may be more of a "who" classicist than davies , who brought sex , romance and a will - they - won't - they element to the series . <end> <start> it may be time for the return of a more fatherly doctor . <end> <start> if you look back across the whole life of the series , capaldi seems very much in the tradition - a likely , almost obvious choice . <end> <start> he has the authority , the madness , the sweetness . <end> <start> at the same time , we don't know how moffat plans to write him . <end> <start> the doctor is as constant as the stars and as changeable as the wind ; he is a warrior clown , comical and stern , a thousand - year - old child , a tenderhearted soul who loves humanity and yet is renowned across the universe as the scourge of worlds . <end> <start> ( typically , these are worlds that deserve a scourge . ) <end> <start> there is a lot of room to play in there . <end> <start> fans - especially british fans , whose allegiance spans decades and generations , speak of "my doctor" as if every citizen needs to have a favorite - do have strong ideas about what the doctor should be . <end> <start> but variety is in his nature , and in choosing to take this ride , we agree to accept the authenticity of the latest anointed choice - a choice no more in our hands , after all , than it is in the doctor's . <end> <start> he is always surprised by who he next finds himself to be . <end> <start> for most viewers the doctor shapes himself to the actor , even as the actor shapes the part . <end> <start> you want to honor the tradition , naturally , and you can't afford to alienate your audience . <end> <start> still , fear of change is a poor basis for creative decision - the point , moffat told hero complex recently , was to bring the world around : 'you want people to go , 'no , that would never work ! ' . . . <end> <start> and they always get wrenched out of their comfort zone , and then they find the doctor again . <end> <start> and there's such a range of what the doctor can be . " <end> <start> i'm excited . <end>
