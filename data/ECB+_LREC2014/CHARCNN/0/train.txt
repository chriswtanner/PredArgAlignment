<start> saints' pierre thomas placed on ir <end> <start> updated : january 6 , 2011 , 11 : 34 am et <end> <start> the defending champion saints will have try to repeat without their top two power running backs . <end> <start> pierre thomas , one of the stars of last season's super bowl run , was placed on injured reserve on wednesday because of his injured ankle . <end> <start> the saints made that move only one day after placing leading rusher chris ivory on injured reserve because of a left foot injury that occurred during sunday's regular season finale . <end> <start> "that's tough , " quarterback drew brees said of the loss of both running backs this week . <end> <start> "you can't deny that just because of the physical presence they bring and obviously their productivity . " <end> <start> when the saints ( 11 - 5 ) open the playoffs in seattle ( 7 - 9 ) on saturday , the only remaining healthy running backs from their regular season roster will be reggie bush and julius jones . <end> <start> "naturally , i'm going to have to step up , " bush said . <end> <start> bush missed eight games with a fracture in his lower right leg . <end> <start> he has rushed for only 150 yards and has not scored a rushing touchdown this season , but started to look stronger on sunday against tampa bay , when he had 70 yards rushing on just nine carries and had 55 yards receiving on five catches . <end> <start> jones has 193 yards and no touchdowns on the ground . <end> <start> the only other running backs on the roster are fourth - year pro deshawn wynn , who was signed on tuesday but also was with the saints during the preseason , and rookie joique bell , who was signed wednesday from the philadelphia eagles' practice squad . <end> <start> brees said he remained optimistic that the versatility of the saints' offense and the way they spread the ball among so many players will allow them to weather such injuries perhaps better than most teams . <end> <start> "in the end , you just work to the strengths of the guys that you have . <end> <start> you don't worry about what you don't have , just what you have , " brees said . <end> <start> "while you would love to have all of the guys and all of the elements that they bring , i feel like reggie bush can do some pretty special stuff and julius jones can do some pretty special stuff . <end> <start> deshawn wynn , when called upon , can do the job . <end> <start> you realize that the passing game may have to pick up some slack at times depending on how the game plan changes by having those guys in . " <end> <start> bush , who returned from his broken right fibula on thanksgiving , said he has been feeling stronger lately and is looking forward to the chance to be the primary running back . <end> <start> however , he stressed that the success of the offense would hinge on many more factors than him . <end> <start> "it's about a team effort . <end> <start> it's not just about one person , " bush said . <end> <start> "we have some mistakes that we made as a team throughout the season on offense , defense and special teams that we've got to clean up . <end> <start> the running back position is just one small piece of the puzzle . " <end> <start> yet as the playoffs approached , the saints had been optimistic their offense would be better with thomas , who scored memorable touchdowns in both the nfc title game and super bowl last season . <end> <start> plagued by a left ankle injury that limited him to only six games this season , thomas started to look effective again in a 17 - 14 victory at atlanta in week 16 , when he had 102 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown . <end> <start> however , he aggravated the injury in practice last week and sat out the regular season finale . <end> <start> "the setback he had was substantial and we're at that point in the season where you want to do what's best , and yet you want to be mindful of the injury the player has , " saints coach sean payton said . <end> <start> "so i think on all fronts - - doctors , trainers , the player and ourselves - - we felt that this was the best move . " <end> <start> thomas initially was hurt in an overtime loss to atlanta in week 3 , then missed nine games before coming back for three late - season games . <end> <start> he finished with 269 yards and two touchdown rushing and caught 29 passes for 201 yards . <end> <start> late this season , thomas also had handled kickoff returns after courtney roby was placed on injured reserve with a head injury . <end> <start> payton said receivers devery henderson and robert meachem are getting most of the practice time in that area this week . <end> <start> ivory's injury is a lisfranc , which is a fracture and dislocation in the mid - foot , and will require surgery , payton said . <end> <start> after joining the saints as an undrafted rookie out of division ii tiffin , he rushed for 716 yards in 12 games and had a team - leading five rushing tds . <end>

kickbacks from shipping and trucking companies on the new jersey waterfront in exchange for labor peace ; protection payoffs from merchants at the fulton fish market ; and the control of many union jobs at the jacob k . javits convention center in manhattan . <end> <start> mr . gigante's influence even extended over the san gennaro street festival in little italy until a 1995 crackdown by new york city officials and federal prosecutors resulted in allegations that the genovese family operated gambling games at the festival , extorted payoffs from venders and pocketed thousands of dollars donated to a neighborhood church . <end> <start> in the 1980's , after the authorities said mr . gigante had assumed undisputed command of the genovese family , he conducted his activities in a starkly unorthodox fashion for a mafia leader . <end> <start> most days , in the early evening , mr . gigante , a hulking man who was about six feet tall and weighed 200 pounds , would emerge from his mother's walkup apartment building on sullivan street in greenwich village . <end> <start> sometimes dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas and sometimes wearing a windbreaker and shabby trousers and always accompanied by one or two bodyguards , he gingerly crossed the street to the triangle civic improvement association , a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters . <end> <start> inside , he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with men who agents said were his trusted confederates . <end> <start> after midnight , according to f . b . i . surveillance reports , he would be driven to a townhouse near park avenue at east 77th street , that was owned by olympia esposito , who was characterized by mr . gigante's lawyers as his common - law wife and the mother of three of his eight children , vincent , lucia and carmella esposito . <end> <start> f . b . i . agents , who in 1986 observed the townhouse from a nearby rooftop post , said that soon after arriving , mr . gigante would change into more elegant clothes , carry on conversations with associates , and read or watch television before retiring . <end> <start> about 9 or 10 the next morning , he would reappear in his shabby downtown clothes and be driven back to sullivan street or a nearby apartment occupied by his relatives at 505 laguardia place . <end> <start> "it was hard to understand what enjoyment he got out of being a mob boss , " said ronald goldstock , the former director of the new york state organized crime task force . <end> <start> "his only pleasure appeared to be the pure power he exercised . " <end> <start> vincent gigante ( pronounced ji - gant - tee ) was born on march 29 , 1928 , in new york city and grew up on the same streets in greenwich village where he would spend most of his adult life . <end> <start> he was one of five sons of salvatore gigante , a watchmaker , and yolanda gigante , a seamstress , both of whom had immigrated from naples . <end> <start> his mother usually addressed him as "cincenzo , " a diminutive of vincente , and his boyhood friends shortened that into his lifelong nickname , "chin . " <end> <start> a lackadaisical student , mr . gigante graduated from p . s . 3 , an elementary school in greenwich village and dropped out of textile high school in manhattan in the ninth grade . <end> <start> police detectives said that as a teen - ager , he became a prot�g� of vito genovese , who was a potent mafia leader in the united states and in italy from the 1930's to the 1960's and whose name still describes the organized - crime group he headed until his death in 1969 . <end> <start> the gang was founded in the 1930's by one of the nation's most notorious criminals , charles ( lucky ) luciano , who was deported to italy and who died in 1962 . <end> <start> mr . genovese is believed to have endeared himself to the gigantes when vincent was a boy with a loan to pay for surgery needed by mrs . gigante . <end> <start> between age 17 and 25 , mr . gigante was arrested seven times on an array of charges : receiving stolen goods , possession of an unlicensed handgun , auto theft , arson and bookmaking . <end> <start> most were dismissed or resolved by fines . <end> <start> his only jail sentence in that period was 60 days for a gambling conviction . <end> <start> when arrested in his early 20's , he listed his occupation as a tailor . <end> <start> but as a strapping youth with quick fists , he was better known as a prize fighter . <end> <start> mr . gigante , from age 16 to 19 , fought as a light heavyweight in clubs around town , winning 21 of 25 light - heavyweight bouts , according to nat fleischer's ring record book . <end> <start> club boxers in those days fought four - and six - round contests in neighborhood arenas , usually getting a percentage of the tickets they themselves sold . <end> <start> one of mr . gigante's managers was a greenwich village neighbor , thomas ( tommy ryan ) eboli , who later became the boss of the genovese family . <end> <start> former new york city detectives who were assigned to organized - crime intelligence units said that mr . gigante earned his mafia spurs as an enforcer in the 1950's . <end> <start> but his prominence in the underworld surged in 1957 , when mr . genovese wrested control of a mob family from frank costello , who had been a close friend of lucky luciano and meyer lansky and was one of the best - known underworld figures in america . <end> <start> mr . costello retired abruptly as a boss after a gunman grazed his scalp with a bullet in the vestibule of his apartment building on central park west . <end> <start> a doorman identified the 29 - year - old mr . gigante as the shooter , but mr . costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant and mr . gigante was acquitted in 1958 on charges of attempted murder . <end> <start> a year later , he was convicted with mr . genovese in manhattan on federal charges of heroin trafficking . <end> <start> mr . gigante , who listed his profession as the superintendent of a tenement on bleecker street , was sentenced to seven years in prison . <end> <start> the sentencing judge said he would have imposed a longer sentence but was swayed by a flood of letters from residents of greenwich village and little italy attesting to mr . gigante's good character and his work on behalf of juveniles . <end> <start> he was paroled after five years and detectives said that soon afterward he was promoted from soldier to the rank of capo , or captain , overseeing a group of mafia gangsters known as a crew , in greenwich village . <end> <start> although his headquarters was in lower manhattan and he spent his nights farther uptown , mr . gigante had a home in old tappan , n . j . , where he lived with his wife , the former olympia grippa , and their three daughters and two sons . <end> <start> they are yolanda fyfe , roseanne d'cola and rita gigante , and salvatore and andrew . <end> <start> in 1969 , he was indicted in new jersey on a charge of conspiracy to bribe the entire five - member old tappan police force to alert him to surveillance operations by law enforcement agencies . <end> <start> the accusation was dropped after mr . gigante's lawyers presented reports from psychiatrists that he was mentally unfit to stand trial . <end> <start> mafia informers and defectors said that mr . gigante gained control of the genovese family in a peaceful transition in the early 1980's when the group's acting boss , philip lombardo , stepped down because of ill health , and mr . gigante's main rival , anthony salerno , was imprisoned for life on racketeering charges . <end> <start> mr . salerno died in federal prison in 1992 . <end> <start> as a new godfather , mr . gigante quickly imposed extraordinary security measures . <end> <start> genovese soldiers and associates were forbidden to utter his name or nickname in conversations or telephone calls . <end> <start> when references to him had to be made , capos and soldiers would silently point to their chins or form the letter "c" with their fingers . <end> <start> mr . gigante was indicted in 1990 with 14 others on federal charges in brooklyn that they had conspired to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on multimillion - dollar contracts with the new york city housing authority to install windows . <end> <start> at his arraignment , he appeared in court in his familiar pajamas and bathrobe and a peaked cap . <end> <start> because of defense contentions that he was mentally and physically impaired , his case was severed from the other defendants and legal battles ensued for seven years over his competence to stand trial . <end> <start> a superseding indictment in 1993 brought more serious accusations against him . <end> <start> mr . gigante was charged with being the head of the genovese family and sanctioning the murders of six mobsters and conspiring to kill three others , including john gotti , the boss of the gambino family . <end> <start> mr . gigante , the indictment asserted , wanted mr . gotti eliminated because he had violated mafia protocol by arranging the assassination of the previous gambino boss , paul castellano , without seeking mr . gigante's approval . <end> <start> the evidence in both indictments stemmed mainly from deserters from the genovese and other mob families who entered the government's witness protection program . <end> <start> at sanity hearings in march 1996 , mr . gravano of the gambino family , and alphonse d'arco , the former acting boss of another new york mafia organization , the lucchese crime family , testified that mr . gigante was lucid during top - level mafia meetings and that he had acknowledged to other gangsters that his eccentric behavior was a pretense . <end> <start> mr . gigante's lawyers elicited testimony and reports from psychiatrists and psychologists that from 1969 to 1995 , he had been confined 28 times in hospitals for treatment of hallucinations and that he suffered from "dementia rooted in organic brain damage . " <end> <start> in august 1996 , judge eugene h . nickerson of federal district court in brooklyn ruled that mr . gigante was mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges . <end> <start> the judge found that at least until 1991 , mr . gigante had engaged in an "elaborate deception" with the help of his relatives to deceive psychiatrists about his condition . <end> <start> before the trial began , mr . gigante , who had open - heart surgery in 1988 , had another cardiac operation in december 1996 , putting his fitness to stand trial in doubt once again . <end> <start> mr . gigante had pleaded not guilty and had been free for years on $1 million bond . <end> <start> during the monthlong trial in 1997 , a gaunt - looking mr . gigante sat in a wheelchair , looking blankly into space as witnesses testified and lawyers argued . <end> <start> he did not testify . <end> <start> after three days of deliberations , the jury on july 25 , 1997 , convicted him on charges of running multimillion - dollar rackets as the genovese family chief and of conspiring unsuccessfully in the late 1980's to murder mr . gotti and a genovese family defector . <end> <start> but he was acquitted of ordering three other gangland slayings and the jury was deadlocked on accusations that he ordered four other murders . <end> <start> imposing a sentence of 12 years - instead of a possible maximum of 27 years - and a $1 . 25 million fine , judge jack b . weinstein of federal district court in brooklyn reflected in december 1997 on mr . gigante's career . <end> <start> "he is a shadow of his former self , " the judge said , "an old man finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny .

<start> vincent 'chin' gigante , 77 , crime boss <end> <start> december 20 , 2005 <end> <start> vincent gigante , who died yesterday in federal prison at 77 , was the genovese crime family boss who for three decades feigned lunacy to evade prosecution for crimes ranging from loan sharking to murder to bribing the entire police force of old tappan , n . j . <end> <start> he was known as "chin , " and his moniker was often invoked by denizens of the mafia underworld with a hand - to - chin gesture rather than a word , the better to foil police bugs . <end> <start> to the writers of headlines he was sometimes "daffy don" or "the oddfather" for his habit of walking the streets of the west village clad in a bathrobe , striped pyjamas , and slippers , while muttering incoherently . <end> <start> federal prosecutors claimed it was an act , but it was not until 2003 , after more than three decades of faking mental illness , that gigante admitted in court that he did it to avoid prosecution . <end> <start> his admission came as part of a plea deal on behalf of his son , andrew , also convicted of mob - related activities . <end> <start> for two decades , gigante was head of the genovese crime family , which emerged as the largest of the five new york mafia clans after decades of concerted federal prosecutions decimated its rivals . <end> <start> it was estimated that there were some 300 members of the family under his control . <end> <start> the genovese rackets included guaranteeing labor peace to firms in construction , garbage removal , and trucking ; extorting payoffs from companies doing business at the ports of newark and elizabeth ; various rackets at the fulton fish market and the jacob k . javits convention center ; contracts for window - installation in city housing , and the old standbys of bookmaking , loan - sharking , and narcotics . <end> <start> it was narcotics that first sent gigante to prison , in 1959 , when he received a five - year sentence after being caught conspiring to smuggle heroin from abroad . <end> <start> also sentenced in the case was the man who gave his name to the crime family , vito genovese . <end> <start> genovese ran his organization from behind bars while serving a 15 - year sentence . <end> <start> it was a similar ruse - maintaining control of the family while incarcerated by transmitting orders through his son , andrew - that was gigante's downfall . <end> <start> gigante was born in the bronx to parents who were immigrants from naples , italy . <end> <start> his father was a jewelry engraver , and his mother was a seamstress . <end> <start> born vincenzo , he was called "chin" for short , and his prominent chin probably helped the name stick . <end> <start> he put it to good use as a teenage boxer , winning 21 of 25 club fights . <end> <start> gigante was arrested several times from when he was 17 to 25 , for possession of an unlicensed handgun , gambling , bookmaking , grand larceny , and arson . <end> <start> two of his brothers , mario and ralph , were also identified as mafia soldiers , while another , louis , was a prominent catholic priest as well as a democratic politician in the bronx . <end> <start> in 1957 gigante was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of frank costello , then the head of what would be called the genovese family . <end> <start> he was acquitted despite the testimony of a doorman who claimed to have witnessed the crime ; costello himself claimed not to have seen his assailant , despite being shot at close range from the front . <end> <start> the shot had only "creased his head , " according to reports at the time . <end> <start> the prosecutor in the costello case claimed that gigante was "a young punk on the way up in the underworld who was chosen to kill costello to win his spurs .
