<start> saints' pierre thomas placed on ir <end> <start> updated : january 6 , 2011 , 11 : 34 am et <end> <start> the defending champion saints will have try to repeat without their top two power running backs . <end> <start> pierre thomas , one of the stars of last season's super bowl run , was placed on injured reserve on wednesday because of his injured ankle . <end> <start> the saints made that move only one day after placing leading rusher chris ivory on injured reserve because of a left foot injury that occurred during sunday's regular season finale . <end> <start> "that's tough , " quarterback drew brees said of the loss of both running backs this week . <end> <start> "you can't deny that just because of the physical presence they bring and obviously their productivity . " <end> <start> when the saints ( 11 - 5 ) open the playoffs in seattle ( 7 - 9 ) on saturday , the only remaining healthy running backs from their regular season roster will be reggie bush and julius jones . <end> <start> "naturally , i'm going to have to step up , " bush said . <end> <start> bush missed eight games with a fracture in his lower right leg . <end> <start> he has rushed for only 150 yards and has not scored a rushing touchdown this season , but started to look stronger on sunday against tampa bay , when he had 70 yards rushing on just nine carries and had 55 yards receiving on five catches . <end> <start> jones has 193 yards and no touchdowns on the ground . <end> <start> the only other running backs on the roster are fourth - year pro deshawn wynn , who was signed on tuesday but also was with the saints during the preseason , and rookie joique bell , who was signed wednesday from the philadelphia eagles' practice squad . <end> <start> brees said he remained optimistic that the versatility of the saints' offense and the way they spread the ball among so many players will allow them to weather such injuries perhaps better than most teams . <end> <start> "in the end , you just work to the strengths of the guys that you have . <end> <start> you don't worry about what you don't have , just what you have , " brees said . <end> <start> "while you would love to have all of the guys and all of the elements that they bring , i feel like reggie bush can do some pretty special stuff and julius jones can do some pretty special stuff . <end> <start> deshawn wynn , when called upon , can do the job . <end> <start> you realize that the passing game may have to pick up some slack at times depending on how the game plan changes by having those guys in . " <end> <start> bush , who returned from his broken right fibula on thanksgiving , said he has been feeling stronger lately and is looking forward to the chance to be the primary running back . <end> <start> however , he stressed that the success of the offense would hinge on many more factors than him . <end> <start> "it's about a team effort . <end> <start> it's not just about one person , " bush said . <end> <start> "we have some mistakes that we made as a team throughout the season on offense , defense and special teams that we've got to clean up . <end> <start> the running back position is just one small piece of the puzzle . " <end> <start> yet as the playoffs approached , the saints had been optimistic their offense would be better with thomas , who scored memorable touchdowns in both the nfc title game and super bowl last season . <end> <start> plagued by a left ankle injury that limited him to only six games this season , thomas started to look effective again in a 17 - 14 victory at atlanta in week 16 , when he had 102 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown . <end> <start> however , he aggravated the injury in practice last week and sat out the regular season finale . <end> <start> "the setback he had was substantial and we're at that point in the season where you want to do what's best , and yet you want to be mindful of the injury the player has , " saints coach sean payton said . <end> <start> "so i think on all fronts - - doctors , trainers , the player and ourselves - - we felt that this was the best move . " <end> <start> thomas initially was hurt in an overtime loss to atlanta in week 3 , then missed nine games before coming back for three late - season games . <end> <start> he finished with 269 yards and two touchdown rushing and caught 29 passes for 201 yards . <end> <start> late this season , thomas also had handled kickoff returns after courtney roby was placed on injured reserve with a head injury . <end> <start> payton said receivers devery henderson and robert meachem are getting most of the practice time in that area this week . <end> <start> ivory's injury is a lisfranc , which is a fracture and dislocation in the mid - foot , and will require surgery , payton said . <end> <start> after joining the saints as an undrafted rookie out of division ii tiffin , he rushed for 716 yards in 12 games and had a team - leading five rushing tds . <end>

<start> pierre thomas placed on injured reserve by new orleans saints <end> <start> jan 5 , 2011 <end> <start> pierre thomas was placed on injured reserve by the new orleans saints on wednesday , meaning he won't play in the 2011 nfl playoffs . <end> <start> losing thomas is bad enough , but it is compiled with the fact that they just lost chris ivory on tuesday . <end> <start> this means they will be missing two of their best players in the rushing game , and it could weaken the attack that the saints have on offense even further . <end> <start> coach sean payton announced it himself on wednesday , revealing through the new orleans saints twitter account that thomas had been placed on ir . <end> <start> it was a very shocking revelation in the roster moves the saints have been making and any saints fan that came into the postseason extremely confident about their team should be a tad worried about what the saints can do now . <end> <start> they still have reggie bush and julius jones to head the running game , so at least the saints weren't left empty handed . <end> <start> last season it was thomas that led the saints in rushing , posting 793 total yards in 14 games . <end> <start> he had been hobbled this year , and that was the main reason that ivory ended up seeing so much playing time . <end> <start> ivory rushed for 716 yards this year , leading the saints in rushing , and giving them a great option as they tried to survive without thomas and bush behind quarterback drew brees on offense . <end> <start> we reported tuesday how ivory is done for the year , and it raises the chances of seattle pulling off an upset on saturday . <end> <start> the seattle vs . new orleans game will be the first one on wild card weekend , with kickoff scheduled for 1 : 30 p . m . pst . <end> <start> seattle is the big underdog in this game , even though it is the team hosting the game . <end> <start> getting to play in front of the home crowd and going up against a banged - up saints team could be exactly what the seahawks need to pull an upset , but they will need quarterback matt hasselbeck to come up huge as well . <end> <start> hasselbeck had more than 300 passing yards against the saints back in week 11 , so maybe seattle has a chance after all . <end> <start> as for the saints on offense , they still have super bowl mvp drew brees taking the snaps . <end> <start> he is having a bit of a down year by his standards , especially in the category of interceptions , but this is still a guy who could throw for 400 yards on any given night . <end> <start> a lot will be asked of him on saturday , but he has been in pressure - packed games quite a few times at this point in his career . <end>
