<start> according to this l.a. times story ( which credits the team-owned flagship radio_station ) , the_angels have made an eight-year offer to free agent first baseman mark_teixeira . <end> <start> the dollar amount was unspecified , but bill shaikin , the fine reporter who wrote the story , says the team was believed to have offered at least $ 160 million . <end> <start> this , obviously , changes the landscape of the teixeira sweepstakes , as the nationals ' best chance for landing him was to blow everyone else out of the water with their offer -- which , apparently , has not happened . <end> <start> that 's not to say the nationals can not sweeten their offer , but team officials have indicated an unwillingness to get into a bidding war with higher-revenue teams . <end> <start> of course , we still have yet to hear from the red sox -- or even the yankees , as i hypothesized in today 's print edition . <end> <start> in any case , it appears this thing is far from over . <end>

" <end> <start> regardless of the money , the team's front office still knows it would take a mild upset for the 28 - year - old to settle on a deal with washington . <end> <start> on sunday night , the los angeles angels withdrew their contract offer to teixeira , believing he had no sincere interest in playing for the organization with which he ended the 2008 season . <end> <start> the boston red sox and baltimore orioles have offers on the table , and though they have yet to make a concrete offer the new york yankees might also contemplate a last - minute bid . <end> <start> various news reports late last week pegged the boston offer to be as high as $184 million over eight years , though subsequent rumors suggested that the numbers are a little lower - - perhaps between $165 million and $180 million . <end> <start> the orioles have the weakest offer of the bunch - - a proposal reportedly worth between $140 million and $150 million over seven years . <end> <start> so far , no team involved has offered a contract longer than eight years . <end> <start> teixeira's agent , scott boras , entered the free agency process hoping his client could attract a 10 - year deal . <end> <start> either way , teixeira will end up with one of the biggest paydays in baseball history , almost certainly exceeding the $161 million ( over seven years ) that fellow free agent cc sabathia received from the yankees earlier this offseason . <end>
<start> the_angels have offered an eight-year contract to mark_teixeira , general manager tony_reagins said friday_night . <end> <start> the contract would be the longest and richest in club history . <end> <start> the value could almost double the previous club record , the $ 90 million guaranteed last year to torii hunter . <end> <start> reagins declined to provide the value of teixeira 's offer . <end> <start> the angels are believed to have offered at least $ 160 million , matching or exceeding the highest offer so far reported for teixeira . <end> <start> owner arte moreno flew from his arizona home to las vegas on tuesday and met personally with scott boras , the agent for teixeira . <end> <start> angels spokesman tim mead said he believed moreno presented the offer to boras at that time . <end> <start> mead also said he did not know when the offer might expire . <end> <start> none of the other teams in the teixeira sweepstakes -- the boston red sox , baltimore orioles and washington nationals -- has been reported to have offered more than eight years . <end> <start> the nationals reportedly have bid $ 160 million over eight years , the orioles between $ 140 million and $ 150 million over seven years . <end> <start> the details of the boston bid have not been reported . <end> <start> the angels had exclusive negotiating rights with teixeira for the first 15 days after the world series , but they declined to make an offer during that time and said they would do so at an appropriate time . <end> <start> boras has had one month since then to solicit bids from other teams , enabling him to let moreno know how the market had developed and enabling moreno to make his first -- and perhaps only -- offer without boras shopping that offer to other teams . <end> <start> the angels have not wavered from treating teixeira as their top priority , even as other coveted options have evaporated . <end> <start> the angels negotiated with pitcher cc sabathia , a favorite among their scouts , but they chose not to make an offer after deciding they would not match the new york yankees ' initial $ 140-million bid . <end> <start> sabathia agreed to a seven-year , $ 161-million deal with the yankees late tuesday night , hours after moreno met with boras . <end> <start> on friday , outfielder raul ibanez signed a three-year , $ 31.5-million contract with the philadelphia phillies . <end> <start> the angels had considered signing ibanez if they lost out on teixeira , with ibanez playing left field and kendry morales replacing teixeira at first base . <end> <start> the angels ' eight-year offer first was reported friday night on the team-owned radio station , am 830 . <end>
<start> sources : sox may not be out of teixeira chase <end> <start> team execs meet with player's agent <end> <start> updated 3 : 09_am_est_dec_19_,_2008 <end> <start> despite saying they have been outbid for free agent first baseman mark_teixeira , the red_sox do not believe they are completely out of the chase , sportscenter_5 has learned . <end> <start> sources have also told sportscenter 5's mike lynch more about the negotiations that took place thursday at teixeira's texas home . <end> <start> lynch reported the red sox team of owner john_henry , coo larry_lucchino and general manager theo_epstein offered teixeira , 28 , an eight_-_year deal worth $184_million or $23_million per season . <end> <start> it was then that agent scott boras countered by asking for an eight - year contract worth $200 million , sources said . <end> <start> lynch reported that henry became infuriated at that point , balking at the massive sum . <end> <start> in an e - mail to media members thursday night , henry said , "we met with mr . teixeira and were very much impressed with him . <end> <start> after hearing about his other offers , however , it seems clear that we are not going to be a factor . " <end> <start> henry's reference to the "other offers" leaves open the possibility that he is calling boras' bluff , who has been known to inflate the value of offers and the number of suitors pursuing his client , lynch reported . <end> <start> boras represented former red sox center fielder johnny damon , who signed with the new york yankees in 2005 after the boston brass apparently refused to believe that the offer from their archrivals was real . <end> <start> lynch also learned that one of teixeira's hometown teams , the washington nationals , has made a huge offer . <end> <start> teixeira is a maryland native . <end> <start> teixeira was traded from atlanta to los angeles in july . <end> <start> he hit . 308 with 33 homers and 121 rbis last season , including . 358 with 13 homers and 43 rbis in 54 games with the angels . <end> <start> the angeles said last week they made an eight - year offer . <end> <start> henry had expressed concern about a contract of eight years or more . <end> <start> "we all have limits , " he wrote the ap on wednesday . <end> <start> "eight years is a very long time in baseball and everywhere else . " <end> <start> he also said the amount the team is willing to spend on a free agent "depends on both" the economy and the player being sought . <end>
<start> super-agent scott boras said leaving the winter meetings that it was going to take an eight-year deal to get the services of slugging first-baseman mark teixeira . <end> <start> the angels apparently are good with that . <end> <start> los angeles general manager tony_reagins has sounded like a broken record saying that resigning teixeira was his top priority , and backed that up now with an eight-year offer . <end> <start> no dollar figures have been released with the offer , but the seven-year offers for teixeira were in the $ 140 million to $ 160 million range and the new offer is expected to be at the top of that range . <end> <start> if accepted , this would certainly be the largest contract in the angels history , dwarfing the four-year , $ 90 million deal that torii hunter got just last summer . <end> <start> but if he keeps mashing like he did after the trade , teixeira could be worth the bank . <end> <start> in 54 games with the angeles he hit .358 with 13 home runs and 43 rbis , and had a slugging percentage of .632 . <end> <start> the two-time gold glove winner also helped solidify the angeles infield . <end> <start> after the winter meetings , the conventional wisdom was that the red sox were the frontrunners for teixeira 's services , even though they met privately and their offer was never made public ( maybe that 's why people thought they were the leaders ) . <end> <start> however , no other offer ( including from the nationals and oriels trying to bring teixeira back to his native maryland ) was thought to be more than seven years . <end> <start> the race for teixeira seems to be in the final furlong . <end> <start> but then again , boras is a patient man , especially if he thinks more money could be around the corner . <end>
<start> the los_angeles_angels made an eight-year offer to first baseman mark_teixeira during winter_meetings in las_vegas . <end> <start> team spokesman tim mead confirmed sunday the angels have withdrawn their offer and are `` out of the mark teixeira derby . '' <end> <start> the team made its offer , reportedly worth about us $ 160 million , during the winter meetings in las vegas earlier this month . <end> <start> the red sox said last week that they `` are not going to be a factor '' in signing the 28-year-old maryland native . <end> <start> washington and baltimore have expressed interest in teixeira . <end> <start> the angels obtained teixeira from the atlanta braves in late july . <end> <start> playing in a combined 157 games with the angels and braves , teixeira had 33 homers and 121 rbis along with a career-best .308 average . <end>
<start> teixeira not headed to boston <end> <start> can you believe it ? <end> <start> i can ’ t . <end> <start> yet it ’ s coming from up top . <end> <start> red sox owner john_henry has said , in so many words , that his team will not sign mark_teixeira . <end> <start> his exact words : <end> <start> “ we met with mr . teixeira and were very much impressed with him . <end> <start> after hearing about his other offers , however , it seems clear that we are not going to be a factor . ” <end> <start> you can follow the entire saga on mlb trade rumors . <end> <start> no one expected this , at least not this soon . <end> <start> the red_sox , the team so many considered the frontrunners for teixeira , will , in the words of the owner himself , not be factors . <end> <start> it appears , from henry ’ s words , the price tag is a bit too high . <end> <start> reports of the red sox offer varied , though wcvb - tv claims it was eight years and $184 million , or a $23 million average annual value . <end> <start> boston could obviously jump back into the picture , but for now it appears they ’ ll let the first baseman sign elsewhere . <end> <start> clearly , i expect a flurry of “ now the yankees have to get him ” comments . <end> <start> think about this , though . <end> <start> there ’ s at least one offer out there better than eight years and $184 million . <end> <start> should the yankees go higher than $25 million a season for teixeira ? <end>
<start> so as things turn out , apparently there are teams in major league baseball not named the new york yankees who are willing to spend money this winter . <end> <start> after letting francisco rodriguez leave to join the new york mets and failing to sign cc sabathia , the angels find themselves with some money laying around , and they 've decided to spend it on mark teixeira . <end> <start> according to a report in the los_angeles_times , the_angels have made an offer to the free agent first baseman that would be the biggest contract in the history of the franchise , surpassing the $ 90 million deal they gave to torii_hunter last season . <end> <start> while the numbers are n't confirmed , the deal is believed to be an offer of eight years and around $ 160 million . <end> <start> owner arte moreno flew from his arizona home to las vegas on tuesday and met personally with scott boras , the agent for teixeira . <end> <start> angels spokesman tim mead said he believed moreno presented the offer to boras at that time . <end> <start> mead also said he did not know when the offer might expire . <end> <start> the angels , of course , are one of four teams that are known to be pursuing teixeira . <end> <start> the nationals offered him the same deal as the angels , the orioles have made an offer between $ 140 and $ 150 million over seven years , and nobody knows for sure what the red sox have offered . <end> <start> i 'm pretty sure the red sox offer will be the only one the angels have to compete with because even though the nationals and orioles are close to teixeira 's home , neither have any realistic expectation of competing for a world series next season , with or without teixeira . <end> <start> in other news , somewhere manny ramirez just punched something . <end>
<start> with last night 's news from los angeles angels gm tony_reagins that the team has made an eight-year contract offer ( dollars undisclosed ) to 1b mark_teixeira , the trade rumor being reported , most recently by john_perrotto at baseball_prospectus , about the_angels going after san diego padres ' ace is likely caput . <end> <start> perrotto 's iteration had aaa rhp nick adenhart and aaa ss brandon wood heading a package that would lead to peavy topping the angels ' rotation . <end> <start> while the angels are being lumped in with the big spenders of baseball ( read : new york yankees and boston red sox ) , there is little to indicate the angels ' off-season plans included dropping $ 20mm per on teixeira and another $ 15 + mm on a starting pitcher . <end> <start> as a back-up plan to a failure to land teixeira , yes . <end> <start> however , an interesting scenario develops if teixeira spurs the west coast in favor of working closer to home for the washington nationals or baltimore orioles . <end> <start> in this scenario , the angels would have the luxury of dealing peavy to the padres for a wood/adenhart/reggie willits/reliever package , and reviving its offense with the signings of non-tender 3b/2b ty wigginton and jonny gomes . <end>

<start> judge sentences orozco to death <end> <start> posted : 05_/_02_/_07_,_9_:_00_pm_pdt_| <end> <start> a norwalk superior court judge on_thursday upheld a jury's recommendation that convicted cop killer jose_luis_orozco die for his crimes . <end> <start> judge philip_hickok told a packed courtroom that he weighed all the aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances in the ambush slaying of los angeles county sheriff's deputy jerry_ortiz in_june_2005 , and he concluded that the case "absolutely warrants death instead of life without parole . " <end> <start> orozco was convicted march 20 of first - degree murder for the slaying of ortiz , a 15 - year veteran and member of the anti - gang detail at the sheriff's lakewood station . <end> <start> a jury recommended on april 3 that orozco be executed . <end> <start> wearing the orange los angeles county jail - issued jumpsuit and with his handcuffed wrists chained to his waist , orozco smiled as he was led from the courtroom for the last time and turned to make an obscene gesture at a photographer . <end> <start> in denying an automatic motion by the defense to reduce the jury's recommendation from death to life in prison without the possibility of parole , hickok called the slaying of the newlywed deputy and father of two "a cold - blooded , vicious murder . " <end> <start> `colossal' factors <end> <start> hickok said the aggravating factors in the case were "colossal . " <end> <start> he noted the 29 - year - old gang member not only killed the deputy while hiding outside of the lawman's view behind a door , orozco also allegedly tried to kill another man just a few days earlier by shooting that individual in the back twice , and had bragged about killing the officer . <end> <start> he had also boasted prior to ortiz's killing that he wanted to kill a cop , that he wanted to make a name for his gang , the judge added . <end> <start> "the murder was committed without regard in front of two extremely impressionable and young girls , " hickok said , referring to the star witnesses in the case , two sisters - 8 - and 10 - year - old girls - who described the shooting for the jury . <end> <start> " ( orozco ) arranged to have witnesses , including those two very young girls , killed so that they would not testify , " hickok said . <end> <start> dozens of deputies - many in uniform - packed the court for thursday's sentencing , just as they had every day of the trial . <end> <start> in the center of the gallery was the slain deputy's wife , chela ortiz , who linked hands with her mother - in - law , rosa ortiz , and her husband's siblings . <end> <start> chela spoke briefly before hickok made the final ruling , addressing her husband's killer directly as she read from a letter written by her stepson , jeremy ortiz , and then made her own statement . <end> <start> "why did you do it ? <end> <start> why did you have to stand behind a door like a coward ? " the young widow read from the teen's letter . <end> <start> chela ortiz , who married the deputy three weeks before he was murdered , told orozco in a firm voice , "i want you to know you did not break our family , " as her family began to cry . <end> <start> "our jerry is in heaven , we will see him again . . . <end> <start> his memory will live on , " she said amid the sounds of soft sobs and sniffles . <end> <start> "and you will always be remembered as a coward . " <end> <start> the 35 - year - old deputy was killed on june 24 , while investigating an attack in which orozco shot a man in the back while doing yard work at a hawaiian gardens home four days earlier . <end> <start> along with murder , orozco was convicted of one count of attempted murder involving the earlier shooting and two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon . <end> <start> jurors also found true the special circumstance allegations of murder of a peace officer , murder while lying in wait and murder to avoid arrest , along with the allegations that he personally discharged a handgun and committed the crimes for the benefit of a criminal street gang . <end> <start> in addition to asking the judge to reduce the sentence thursday , orozco's attorneys made a motion for a new trial , arguing that the da was wrongly allowed to bring in overwhelmingly prejudicial material about orozco's gang ties . <end> <start> the attorneys also argued that the defense was hamstrung when the judge refused to let them bring in the rev . gregory boyle to testify on his gang experience in the penalty phase of the trial . <end> <start> they said the judge also refused to let them add jury instructions about others who could be guilty of aiding and abetting orozco . <end> <start> prosecutors pointed out all those arguments had been made during the guilt or penalty phase of the trial , and the judge had already ruled in the matters . <end> <start> hickok agreed and denied both motions . <end> <start> `tragic situation' <end> <start> outside court , defense attorney stanley perlo said his client stands little chance at winning an appeal in the state supreme court , which he described as "very pro death . " <end> <start> in the ninth district court of appeals , there is a chance they will see that the defense was denied a key witness in the penalty phase of the trial , he said . <end> <start> neither perlo nor his co - counsel , robin yanes , ever claimed their client's innocence . <end> <start> their client had committed the crimes , both attorneys said thursday . <end> <start> rather , they argued that the defendant's lifetime of gang membership and drug abuse were mitigating factors that could not be ignored and that should have spared him death . <end> <start> they added that many of the people called to testify against their client were equally responsible for the deputy's slaying and yet were not prosecuted . <end> <start> "it's a tragic situation with nothing but a sad ending . <end> <start> what else could it be ? " yanes said . <end> <start> asked about the pending appeal , deputy district attorney phil stirling said such cases can never be predicted , but added that he and lowell anger - the lead da on the case - were confident the conviction and sentence would stand . <end> <start> after the sentencing , stirling called orozco a "predator . " <end> <start> "he is a killer . <end> <start> he murdered deputy sheriff jerry ortiz , in addition to attempting to murder at least three other people that we know of , " stirling said . <end> <start> orozco's death sentence will be automatically appealed to the california_supreme_court and he was ordered to be transferred within 10_days from county_jail to san_quentin_state_prison , where he will await his appeal on death_row . <end> <start> "he'll probably live a much longer , healthier life on death row than he would have on the streets , " perlo said . <end>

" <end> <start> ortiz , who had hoped to become a detective soon , had worked for the sheriff's department for 15 years and was known as an extremely hard worker whose job was to penetrate the inner workings of local gangs . <end> <start> the diamond bar resident was married two weeks ago to his second wife , chela . <end> <start> he is also survived by two sons , ages 6 and 16 . <end> <start> last year , ortiz won the department's medal of honor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner , det . colin orpe . <end> <start> "he was an outstanding person , who would go out of his way to help people , " said orpe , a longtime friend . <end> <start> "we're all mourning , " he said , choking back tears . <end> <start> the shooting occurred about_3_:_10_p_._m_. in_the_12200_block_of_223rd_street_in_hawaiian_gardens_,_a_working_-_class_city_at_the_northeastern_border_of_long_beach that has long been plagued by gang violence . <end> <start> the town of 14 , 000 has struggled economically in recent years , luring a casino to help balance its shaky finances . <end> <start> ortiz's body was discovered by residents who heard the gunfire . <end> <start> they tried to aid the deputy and dialed 911 , authorities said . <end> <start> ortiz was working without his longtime partner at the time of the attack . <end> <start> undersheriff larry waldie said ortiz had arrived for work early , as he often did , and was so eager to begin his day that he struck out on his own . <end> <start> "he didn't want to wait , " waldie said . <end> <start> asked if ortiz might have lived had his partner been with him , waldie said there was no way to know . <end> <start> "there might have been two people killed , " he said . <end> <start> the shooting was followed by confusion as scores of deputies descended on the area with dogs and rifles but little knowledge of what had occurred . <end> <start> a sheriff's swat team encircled the apartment complex where it was believed that the gunman could be hiding . <end> <start> patrol deputies detained as many as nine potential witnesses and others in an effort to learn details of the shooting . <end> <start> nearly all of them were rounded up in a liquor store next to the apartment complex . <end> <start> television news footage showed the men and women sitting on the curb in handcuffs as deputies interviewed them and swabbed their hands for possible gunshot residue . <end>
<start> deputy's killer gets death sentence <end> <start> the gang member shot jerry_ortiz outside_a_hawaiian_gardens_building in_2005 . <end> <start> april_04_,_2007 <end> <start> a norwalk jury on_tuesday ordered execution for a gang member convicted of murdering a los angeles county sheriff's deputy in_june_2005 . <end> <start> deputy luis_gerardo_"jerry"_ortiz , 35 , was shot outside_a_hawaiian_gardens_apartment_building while investigating jose_luis_orozco in_connection with another shooting . <end> <start> orozco , 29 , was found guilty by the same jury last_month of first - degree murder with the special circumstances of murder of a police_officer and possession of a firearm by a felon . <end> <start> "this is the kind of person and the kind of crime that the death penalty was made for , " said dist . atty . steve cooley . <end> <start> sheriff's deputy timothy brennan , who had been ortiz's partner for a year , called the verdict bittersweet . <end> <start> he explained , "you feel good , but it's never going to bring jerry back to his family and friends . " <end> <start> orozco is to be formally sentenced may 3 by judge philip h . hickock . <end> <start> stanley perlo , one of orozco's lawyers , said his client grew up "in a gang - infested area . <end> <start> for all intents and purposes , the gang became his family . " <end> <start> perlo said orozco was consumed by gang life in much the same way one is addicted to drugs , affecting his judgment . <end> <start> a 15 - year department veteran , ortiz had hoped to become a detective . <end> <start> he had married two weeks before the shooting , and had won a department medal of honor for fatally shooting a suspected carjacker who had pulled a gun on him and his partner . <end> <start> the jury reached its verdict in less than a day . <end> <start> jurors on_monday asked to review a video recording of orozco boasting about the shooting to other jail inmates two_weeks after ortiz's death . <end> <start> the recording , which was presented during the trial , showed orozco talking about his appearance on the "america's most wanted" television show . <end>
<start> deputy's alleged killer held <end> <start> a 27 - year - old parolee is found 'cowering in_a_bathtub'_near_the_house where jerry_ortiz had been shot in_the_head a_few_hours_earlier . <end> <start> june_26_,_2005 <end> <start> before he was fatally shot , los angeles county sheriff's deputy jerry_ortiz was looking for a man considered to be a "career criminal" and was hoping to arrest him on suspicion of attempted murder , officials said saturday . <end> <start> that man , jose luis orozco , is now the main suspect in the friday afternoon slaying of ortiz in hawaiian gardens . <end> <start> orozco was arrested around midnight friday by a sheriff's swat team , three houses from the scene of the fatal shooting . <end> <start> he was found "cowering in a bathtub , " sheriff lee baca said . <end> <start> ortiz , a gang enforcement officer , was searching for orozco because he was a suspect in a shooting that occurred in the neighborhood monday , said sheriff's capt . ray peavy , a homicide investigator . <end> <start> orozco , 27 , a known gang member , was also suspected of violating parole after serving time for a weapons violation , peavy said . <end> <start> ortiz , 35 , was on his own about 3 p . m . friday when he went to a house in hawaiian gardens , a working - class city at the northeast border of long beach with long - standing gang problems . <end> <start> peavy said the specific reason for ortiz's visit was unknown but he provided a few details about the encounter : a woman answered the door and a man walked up behind her . <end> <start> ortiz asked the man for some identification and was checking it when orozco appeared from inside the house . <end> <start> he shot ortiz once in_the_head and fled , peavy said . <end> <start> dozens of law enforcement officers worked the case through the afternoon and into the night , fanning out around the 12200 block of 223rd street and questioning residents . <end> <start> deputies believed they knew where orozco was hiding and obtained a search warrant . <end> <start> a handgun was recovered during the arrest , peavy said . <end> <start> orozco , who was booked on suspicion of violating his parole , is being held without bail . <end> <start> los angeles county dist . atty . steve cooley said he expected orozco to be charged with first - degree murder of a peace officer , which means he could receive the death penalty if he is convicted . <end> <start> peavy could not say what orozco was doing in the house , but said he had been living on the street and sleeping in different places . <end> <start> baca , who had been in kentucky for a meeting of the national sheriffs' assn . , returned to los angeles for a news conference held saturday with cooley and los angeles mayor - elect antonio villaraigosa . <end> <start> baca praised the work of his investigators , but the arrest seemed to do little to quell his anger . <end> <start> he called orozco "the scum of the earth" and an "idiot , " pointing to a photo of the suspect and the "devil horns" tattooed on his bald head . <end> <start> cooley unfurled a long trail of printer paper that baca said contained orozco's criminal record , including drug and weapon violations , resisting arrest , burglary and assault with a deadly weapon . <end> <start> the sheriff contrasted the suspect's life with that of ortiz , a 15 - year department veteran . <end> <start> ortiz "not only exemplified the best of what we have , but took it upon himself to work in the toughest job that we also have - - and that is trying to do something about this out - of - control gang problem in los angeles county , " baca said . <end> <start> baca urged everyone in southern california to pay more attention to the gang problem . <end> <start> he called for broader prevention initiatives , lamented the lack of resources in his department and urged parents to get involved in the lives of their children . <end> <start> cooley said the fact that orozco hadn't been in contact with his parole officer since january was a "failure" of the system , but he did not elaborate . <end> <start> undersheriff larry waldie said that ortiz set out without a partner friday because he had arrived early and was eager to get to work . <end> <start> peavy said ortiz usually partnered with one of two deputies , but both had the day off . <end> <start> instead , ortiz had planned to partner with his sergeant . <end> <start> but he apparently decided to visit the house first . <end> <start> peavy noted that such solo work is not a violation of department policy . <end> <start> ortiz , of diamond bar , was an army veteran and the father of two boys , ages 6 and 16 . <end> <start> he was married for the second time about two weeks ago . <end> <start> his family declined a request for an interview saturday through a sheriff's spokesman . <end> <start> but colleagues described him as someone who lived for police work and was a "fanatic" about boxing . <end> <start> he fought on the sheriff's boxing team and trained recruits and deputies in hand - to - hand combat . <end> <start> lt . bob rifkin of operation safe streets , the department's gang unit , said ortiz became interested in the gang problem while working as a patrol officer from 1996 to 2000 . <end> <start> he joined the gang unit in 2001 after passing a background check and written exam that tested his knowledge of gang culture . <end> <start> ortiz won numerous commendations for his work . <end> <start> last year , he was awarded the city of lakewood's medal of valor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner . <end> <start> "jerry was 35 years old and had more motivation than a 21 - year - old just getting on the department , " rifkin said . <end> <start> "he always wanted to go toward the action and that's what jerry was respected for . " <end> <start> baca noted that ortiz's family has had "tremendous tragedies when it comes to those members who've been in law enforcement . " <end> <start> in january , ortiz's brother - in - law , manuel a . gonzalez , was stabbed to death while working as a corrections officer at a state prison in chino . <end> <start> the alleged killer , jon christopher blaylock , was serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a police officer . <end>

<start> death for orozco <end> <start> posted : 04_/_02_/_07_,_9_:_00_pm_pdt | <end> <start> a convicted cop killer laughed tuesday after hearing a jury's ruling that he be put to death . <end> <start> jose_luis_orozco showed almost no emotion throughout the three_-_week trial in which he was convicted of the 2005 murder of los angeles county sheriff's deputy jerry_ortiz . <end> <start> a rare exception for the 29 - year - old hawaiian gardens gang member was an occasional smile for his mother when he turned in his chair to glance back at her from time to time . <end> <start> he will be sentenced may 3 . <end> <start> when the jury convicted him last month of the deputy's slaying , as well as the attempted murder of another man just a few days prior to the ambush killing of ortiz , orozco sat staring straight ahead , unflinching . <end> <start> as court clerk dan fallon read the jury's sentence shortly before noon tuesday , several members of the slain lawman's family gasped , clutching one another's hands . <end> <start> at the same time , a small smile spread across orozco's face and he chuckled . <end> <start> "we understand and we appreciate the gravity of the decision that the jury had to make . . . , and that it took a lot for them to ( come to that decision ) , " chela ortiz , the deputy's wife , said afterward . <end> <start> "we appreciate everything they did , we know they were very careful . . . and gave this a lot of their attention . " <end> <start> chela ortiz - who was married three weeks before her husband was murdered - sat with her mother in - law , rosa ortiz , and the rest of the family every day of the trial . <end> <start> they were accompanied by dozens of sheriff's deputies and other family friends , including the family's priest . <end> <start> most days were difficult and filled with tears as they listened to chilling testimony recounting the last few minutes of ortiz's life and saw , for the first time , the crime scene and autopsy photos . <end> <start> "i think , for all of us , it was kind of reliving the nightmare all over , " chela ortiz said . <end> <start> family members listened to testimony that included the defendant's violent past and the many times he escaped prosecution by using his gang's influence and power to intimidate victims - including two nearly killed when they were shot and stabbed in the back by orozco , according to prosecutors . <end> <start> orozco's friends and fellow gang members also recalled his boasting about killing a cop one day . <end> <start> "i just say thank god it is over , " the deputy's mother , rosa ortiz , said . <end> <start> "it was too much some days . . . <end> <start> to me it was too hard . " <end> <start> it took the jury of six men and six women a little more than four hours , spread over two days , to choose death over life in prison without the possibility of parole . <end> <start> it was almost the same amount of time used to come to the guilty verdict on march 20 . <end> <start> according to three jurors who spoke briefly outside the courtroom , the decision was a difficult one made slightly easier by the thorough job of the prosecutors and investigators . <end> <start> none of them wanted to be identified because of the gang ties to the case . <end> <start> the physical evidence , which including orozco's dna and fingerprints found on the murder weapon , was overwhelming , they said . <end> <start> there were also a number of eye witnesses including two girls who described for the jury how orozco hid behind their front door and shot the deputy as ortiz spoke with their mother . <end> <start> equally as damning , jurors said , was the complete lack of remorse shown by the defendant . <end> <start> he squandered two opportunities to turn his life around , including chances to relocate out of state and away from the gang with his family in las vegas and again with a friend and former gang member in florida , they said . <end> <start> it looked to them as though he preferred the life of a criminal and reveled in the notoriety he earned in the deputy's death . <end> <start> a taped conversation between orozco and two friends - one a fellow gang member and the other an associate - in a holding cell at the bellflower courthouse made it clear to the jury that a life in prison would not diminish his threat to society , they said . <end> <start> in that tape , orozco is heard talking about destroying evidence and ordering a hit on the two little girls and their mother - the star witnesses in the case . <end> <start> "i had to hear that tape again , " one juror said . <end> <start> "because if we were going to send him to jail for life , he could run the same business from behind bars , " a second juror added . <end> <start> "this way he can't harm anyone anymore . " <end> <start> apartment murder <end> <start> ortiz was assigned to track orozco down the day before his june 24 , 2005 murder . <end> <start> that task stemmed from the june 20 , 2005 shooting of a black man who - according to prosecutors - orozco tried to kill simply because of his race . <end> <start> the 15 - year veteran , who learned the day before that he had made the rank of detective , was patrolling in hawaiian gardens near 223rd street when he spotted orozco and tried to stop him . <end> <start> the gang member took off running with ortiz behind him , according to court testimony . <end> <start> ortiz followed orozco to an apartment complex in the 12500 block of east 223rd street , to the home of one of orozco's friends whom the deputy knew from previous altercations , at about 3 : 30 p . m . <end> <start> what ortiz didn't know was that orozco was lurking behind the woman's front door . <end> <start> as ortiz spoke to her and reholstered his weapon , orozco steadied his hand while two of the woman's children - girls age 6 and 8 - and several of her friends looked on . <end> <start> he fired just one shot from his . 38 - caliber revolver , with the slug passing through a crack in the door and hitting the deputy in the side of the head . <end> <start> the 35 - year - old newlywed and father to two boys died almost immediately . <end> <start> tactical decision <end> <start> stan perlo , one of two court - appointed defense attorneys assigned to orozco , said the defendant's lack of support from his family dealt a massive blow to their case . <end> <start> originally , orozco's mother was to take the stand to tell her son's story and talk about the many problems he faced growing up , perlo said . <end> <start> but she became nervous , telling her son the night before she was to testify that she did not want to go through with it , perlo explained . <end> <start> orozco agreed not to force his mother to have to take the witness stand , a decision that likely destroyed his chance at any mercy on the part of the jury , he said . <end> <start> "our problem was we had no one to tell his story , " perlo said . <end> <start> "we were counting on his mom and . . . she was too nervous to testify . " <end> <start> perlo and co - counsel robin yanes approached orozco's case from a somewhat unorthodox position . <end> <start> rather than argue their client's innocence , they repeatedly referred to their client as the gunman in the presence of the jury and focused on a number of other people they claimed were equally responsible in the crime . <end> <start> it was a tactical decision reached by the two veteran attorneys , both with extensive experience with death penalty cases , and after consultation with their peers , perlo explained . <end> <start> "we made a lot of decisions that some lawyers would disagree with , " he said . <end> <start> "i would add , personally , a lot of lawyers with a lot less experience . " <end> <start> long process <end> <start> when orozco returns to court on may 3 , perlo and yanes will argue for a mistrial and , if that is rejected , will ask judge philip hickok to modify the jury's verdict and consider life without parole . <end> <start> the chance either argument will be successful is slight , perlo said . <end> <start> but that then sets into motion the automatic appeals process , something that will be handled by a different set of attorneys . <end> <start> during that time , orozco will not be housed with the general population , he will have a cell all his own giving him isolation from much of the gang violence in the state's prisons . <end> <start> at the very least , perlo estimated the appeals process will last five years . <end> <start> it could run into 20 years because there are both state and federal requirements that must be met , he added . <end> <start> a large part of the problem stems from finding lawyers who are available for such a lengthy commitment of time , who are willing to take on a stressful job and who are qualified , perlo said . <end> <start> "the decision today made the family happy , but unfortunately it's a false happiness , " perlo said after court tuesday . <end> <start> "i've dealt with issues of death for many years . . . <end> <start> the death penalty rarely offers . . . closure . " <end> <start> the ortiz family , however , disagreed . <end> <start> "i'm kind of relieved that it's over , " said 17 - year - old jeremy ortiz , one of the deputy's sons from a previous marriage . <end> <start> "i'm happy with the verdict , we just have to wait it out now . " <end> <start> prior to the reading of the verdict , the deputy's family and friends waited in a courtroom filled to capacity but so quiet one could could hear the slight squeaks of the attorneys' leather chairs . <end> <start> some bowed their heads and rubbed their faces , while others clasped their hands as though in prayer . <end> <start> when the sentence was finally announced a collective gasp for air was followed by cries and sobs as relatives sitting behind the family leaned forward to rub their shoulders and give a comforting squeeze . <end> <start> outside the courtroom , rosa ortiz took out a button with a laminated picture of her slain son in uniform and handed it to the eldest of her five children , art ortiz , so that he could pin it on her blouse . <end> <start> once it was secure she kissed it tenderly . <end> <start> for many minutes afterward , relatives and friends stood outside the courtroom hugging and crying . <end> <start> detective dawn retzlaff , one of the two lead homicide detectives on the case , said authorities were grateful for the jury's thorough and careful review of the facts and investigators were happy with the verdict , calling it just . <end> <start> speaking on behalf of the sheriff's department , retzlaff added that they wanted to express their condolences to ortiz's family in what was a devastating time . <end> <start> "it's not a happy day for anybody , " said deputy district attorney lowell anger , who prosecuted the case along with fellow da phillip stirling . <end> <start> anger said that the message sent by the jury's sentence - that killing a police officer and flaunting all respect for authority and for life will not be tolerated - was clear . <end> <start> it was the constant support from anger , stirling and the district attorney's office , from the sheriff's department and other law enforcement agencies , and from the family's large circle of friends that made the tumultuous trial more bearable , chela and her in - laws insisted . <end> <start> "we could never repay them for all the support and love they have for this family , and that they have for jerry , " chela said . <end>

<start> anger in_east_flatbush persists over teenager ’ s killing by the police <end> <start> published : march_13_,_2013 <end> <start> first came the shooting : an armed teenager killed by police officers on_a_darkened_brooklyn_street . <end> <start> then came the anger : a_monday_evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local_businesses ; a second protest the_next_night ; and another on_wednesday_night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in_the_face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police_van , and there were 46 arrests — mostly for disorderly conduct . <end> <start> two officers suffered minor injuries . <end> <start> by the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released wednesday , the tension in east flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along church avenue . <end> <start> for some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime . <end> <start> for others , it was anything but reassuring . <end> <start> the police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , kimani_gray , just_before_11_:_30_p_._m_._on_saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them . <end> <start> the police commissioner , raymond w . kelly , said tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , “ two of which say that the officers said , ‘ don ’ t move . ’ ” <end> <start> “ another witness said an officer says , ‘ freeze , ’ ” he said . <end> <start> the officers then fired 11 shots , the police said . <end> <start> seven bullets hit mr . gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the new york city office of the chief medical examiner . <end> <start> the autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck mr . gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if mr . gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front . <end> <start> but the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager . <end> <start> on wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil . <end> <start> the gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house . <end> <start> after officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on church avenue , mr . gray ’ s sister mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car . <end> <start> she was given a summons and released . <end> <start> some of the protesters shouted , “ that ’ s the sister , ” then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her . <end> <start> someone hurled a chair . <end> <start> screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets . <end> <start> for local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding mr . gray ’ s death was grimly familiar . <end> <start> less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , shantel davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time . <end> <start> vigils followed that shooting as well . <end> <start> but soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops . <end> <start> “ you try to put it out of your mind , ” said ms . davis ’ s sister crystal . <end> <start> in interviews around east flatbush , many spoke of a police department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones . <end> <start> at a barbershop along church avenue , two men on tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street . <end> <start> “ see that guy ? ” said elverton thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut . <end> <start> “ he can ride on the sidewalk . <end> <start> we can ’ t . ” <end> <start> his barber , julian clark , also black , concurred . <end> <start> two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said . <end> <start> “ they have a hard time because there ’ s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , ” he said of the police . <end> <start> “ but when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . ” <end> <start> the seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths — both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media — has left many feeling suffocated , said shanduke mcphatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood . <end> <start> “ i understand the state of mind that these youths have , ” he said . <end> <start> “ the problem is there is no relationship with the police . ” <end> <start> at the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members . <end> <start> “ the police say , ‘ look at these kids , they ’ re wild , ’ ” mr . mcphatter said . <end> <start> “ and then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . ” <end> <start> the rev . terry lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved “ kids killing kids ” and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings . <end> <start> but he said he understood why . <end> <start> “ the community we ’ re living in can get dangerous at times , ” he said . <end> <start> “ people are afraid of retaliation . ” <end> <start> mr . lee said the local 67th precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years . <end> <start> “ the problem is , people still don ’ t want to go to the police , ” he said . <end> <start> the autopsy report on mr . gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation . <end> <start> one bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right . <end> <start> two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm . <end> <start> john c . cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the police department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of mr . gray ’ s body . <end> <start> “ most of the time , it ’ s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , ” he said , or some combination of the two . <end> <start> once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent . <end> <start> mr . gray ’ s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said . <end> <start> mr . kelly , the police commissioner , said tuesday that there was “ nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . ” <end> <start> mr . cerar concurred , saying , “ under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . ” <end> <start> but raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police . <end> <start> some said mr . gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air . <end> <start> a family friend , kevin blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that mr . gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind . <end> <start> he said he had spoken to mr . gray ’ s parents . <end> <start> “ the dad is shook , ” mr . blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for mr . gray . <end> <start> “ he doesn ’ t sleep . <end> <start> he doesn ’ t talk . <end> <start> he ’ s still in a dream . ” <end> <start> local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements wednesday . <end> <start> “ our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , ” said gilford t . monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said . <end> <start> on tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a rite aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene . <end> <start> the police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone . <end> <start> “ nothing justifies that , ” mr . kelly said . <end> <start> he said at a city council hearing on tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it . <end> <start> “ that belittles it , ” city councilman jumaane d . williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting . <end> <start> “ so now we ’ re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? ” <end>

<start> even as oscar organizers on_friday unveiled hugh_jackman as the host of their gala film awards , the prospect of a u.s. actors strike was casting_a_long_shadow over whether hollywood 's big show would go_on as usual . <end> <start> the academy awards ' february 22 date puts it directly in the path of a potential walkout by screen actors guild members who vote next month on whether to give union leaders permission to call a strike in stalemated contract talks with major studios . <end> <start> movie making by the big studios has wound down since late june in anticipation of labor strife , compounding a general slowdown from the u.s. recession . <end> <start> the tension has only been heightened by fatigue from a tumultuous 14-week hollywood writers strike that ended in february and cost the los angeles area economy around $ 3 billion as production stopped on most prime-time tv shows . <end> <start> `` a strike , if one occurred , would be nothing short of horrible , '' said ron howard , the former actor and oscar-winning director of `` a beautiful mind '' whose latest film , `` frost/nixon , '' is considered a strong oscar contender . <end> <start> `` the timing could n't be worse , '' he said on thursday . <end> <start> actor leonardo dicaprio , who on thursday earned a golden globe nomination for his work in `` revolutionary road , '' said strike concerns are hitting `` everyone . '' <end> <start> `` it 's really important that we come up with a solution , '' he said . <end> <start> `` these are unheard-of times , and no one can predict what is going to happen '' with the u.s. economy . <end> <start> sag 's dark cloud <end> <start> the oscars , given out by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , are annually hollywood 's glitziest night . <end> <start> putting the show in jeopardy , however , was this week 's announcement by sag that strike authorization ballots will be mailed to its 120,000 members on january 2 and tallied on january 23 , a full month before the oscars . <end> <start> that sequence of events raises the prospect of a-list stars boycotting the honors to avoid crossing their own union 's picket lines -- or even carrying picket signs themselves . <end> <start> the same dynamic came into play last january when a work stoppage by 10,500 writers guild of america members threw the awards season into disarray and caused the star-filled golden globe awards to be replaced by a news conference . <end> <start> only 5.8 million tv viewers tuned-in , far below the globes ' typical 20 million audience . <end> <start> broadcaster nbc lost an estimated $ 10 million to $ 15 million in advertising revenue . <end> <start> the writers strike was settled a month later , sparing the academy awards and its network , abc , a similar fate . <end> <start> but this time around , the oscars are on the firing line and australian actor jackman , star of the `` x-men '' movies as well as broadway stage shows , may himself have to pull out . <end> <start> `` at this point , we are moving forward with all of our plans to do our show , and of course we are monitoring what is going on , '' said academy spokeswoman leslie unger . <end> <start> sag leaders say they need a credible strike threat to wrest a better contract deal from the studios than the `` final '' offer management presented before talks collapsed on june 30 . <end> <start> they stress , however , that a `` yes '' vote does not automatically put a strike into effect , and it remains uncertain whether sag can muster the support it needs -- 75 percent of those voting -- to pass its authorization . <end> <start> talks collapsed over issues that included how much actors would get paid for work on the internet , and the financial impact of a possible strike on hollywood remains unclear . <end> <start> most films slated for release in 2009 already have been shot , meaning the 2010 slate would see the brunt of a strike . <end> <start> some tv prime-time dramas and sitcoms will have completed production before sag a work stoppage , though a walkout could hinder development of new series for fall 2009 . <end>

<start> it 's a tough job hosting the academy awards . <end> <start> it 's supposed to be entertaining , but it 's also a night for the stars to revel in the glory of an oscar win . <end> <start> and the host has to be edgy and funny , without going over the line and insulting the honorees . <end> <start> but when it works , as it did in 1992 when tough-guy actor jack palance did push-ups in front of comedian and host billy crystal , only to become the butt of crystal 's jokes for the rest of the night , it makes for memorable moments . <end> <start> on_friday , the organization behind the academy_awards named australian actor hugh_jackman as the host of february 's annual show . <end> <start> jackman is the first non-comedian to single-handedly host the show in recent years . <end> <start> the last time an australian hosted the show was in 1987 , when to `` crocodile dundee '' star paul hogan shared the stage with actress goldie hawn and comedian chevy chase . <end> <start> coming off starring in `` australia , '' which has had only limited box office success since its nov. 26 opening with a total box office take of $ 43 million , jackman will rely on song and dance instead of just jokes to entertain a worldwide audience on oscar night . <end> <start> he has done well hosting the tony awards , the broadway version of the oscars , but the oscars ' audience is used to comedians on the show . <end> <start> on a night where hype and pomp rule , the comedian 's role is often to keep the show grounded by injecting a jester 's dose of realism . <end> <start> jackman 's naming as host prompted a `` love it or hate it '' reaction here on our news floor in los angeles . <end> <start> there did n't seem to be much in between , so we thought we 'd leave it to readers to weigh in with their own thoughts . <end> <start> hugh jackman : an oscar hit or miss ? <end>

" <end> <start> we'll get to hear more of her quips when she leads the oscars ceremony next_march . <end> <start> degeneres previously hosted the 79th oscars in_2007 , and snagged an emmy nod for her work . <end> <start> the daytime talk show host follows seth_macfarlane , whose hosting of the_2013 academy_awards was divisive . <end> <start> "i am so excited to be hosting the oscars for the_second_time , " degeneres said in the academy's announcement . <end>
<start> the producers of the academy awards are counting on a mutant wolverine who is people magazine 's reigning sexiest man alive to inject some desperately needed razzle-dazzle into their annual telecast . <end> <start> hugh_jackman , the australian actor known to film audiences for playing a furry comic-book hero in the x-men movies , will be host of the 81st incarnation of the oscars , the academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences announced on friday . <end> <start> abc will broadcast the awards show on feb. 22 . <end> <start> its producers said they hoped to achieve multiple goals with the casting of mr. jackman . <end> <start> first , there is a desire to put more movie in the annual movie business extravaganza . <end> <start> jon stewart and ellen degeneres , recent hosts , are both primarily known as television stars . <end> <start> laurence mark , a co-producer of the oscars telecast , with bill condon , said there was also a desire to steer clear of stand-up comedians . <end> <start> `` we are trying to get away from this late-night talk show rut , '' mr. mark said in a telephone interview . <end> <start> `` it seemed to us that we needed to turn a corner and get somebody who is , imagine that , a movie star . '' <end> <start> mr. jackman 's selection is also an attempt to play to the audience at home , which has been shrinking in recent years . <end> <start> viewers of the ceremony are overwhelmingly female - the oscars are known in the advertising world as the super bowl for women - and producers clearly expect mr. jackman to turn out that demographic in droves . <end> <start> `` it certainly did not escape us that hugh looks terrific in a tuxedo , '' mr. mark said . <end> <start> with any luck , a host plucked from within the movie industry 's own ranks - and less emphasis on stand-up comedy , which has often been at the expense of people sitting in the audience - will also play well inside the kodak theater . <end> <start> in recent years the crowd of movie insiders has seemed to respond to hosts with notable coldness . <end> <start> a representative for mr. jackman said he was walking a red carpet in berlin on behalf of his current film , the epic `` australia , '' and was unavailable for an interview . <end> <start> deadlinehollywooddaily.com first reported his selection on the web . <end> <start> mr. jackman , 40 , has never been nominated for an oscar but has artistic credibility , an important credential for the m.c. of the film awards show . <end> <start> he has won positive reviews for turns in films like `` the prestige '' and `` kate and leopold . '' <end> <start> he won a tony award in 2004 for his role in the musical `` the boy from oz . '' <end> <start> he also has experience as an awards show m.c. , winning an emmy in 2005 for his appearance as host of the tonys . <end> <start> he presided over that ceremony three times . <end> <start> the oscars are a very different phenomenon from the tonys . <end> <start> the film honors are an awkward hybrid - a telecast about the movies set in a theater - that require their host to oscillate between jocular chitchat and solemn introductions , while sprinkling in just the right amount of self-deprecation . <end> <start> serving as host of the three-hour live show requires physical stamina and an ability to hold up under the emotional pressure of knowing that the television audience , while diminished in the united states , numbers several hundred million worldwide . <end> <start> this year mr. jackman will have the added pressure of serving as the ringmaster of a lavish self-congratulation-a-thon at a time of global economic crisis . <end> <start> preparing for the job may prove difficult , since producers will most likely need to draw up contingency plans in the event of a screen actors guild strike . <end> <start> the union , at loggerheads with studios over contract issues big and small , said on wednesday that it would ask its members to authorize a strike . <end> <start> the union , which will announce the results of the vote in late january , sees its power to wreak havoc with the oscars as prime leverage . <end> <start> the telecast has come under harsh criticism in recent years as a lumbering snore that takes itself too seriously and lacks spontaneity . <end> <start> star wattage has dimmed , with many members of the a list refusing to attend unless they are nominated or have a coming film to promote . <end> <start> a trend toward honoring small , independent movies that most people have not seen has dented viewership . <end> <start> ratings for last year 's oscars plunged to a record low , with about 32 million people tuning in , compared with 55.3 million a decade ago . <end> <start> mr. condon and mr. mark , who recently served as the creative team behind the movie `` dreamgirls , '' are trying to energize the telecast partly by making the ceremony more of a party that celebrates movies in general , not just the elite few selected by academy voters . <end> <start> `` we are still at the preliminary conversation stage about what hugh wants to do , but his theatrical talent certainly does give us reason to do at least one musical number , '' mr. mark said . <end>
<start> ellen_degeneres to host the oscars <end> <start> published_august_02_,_2013 <end> <start> ellen_degeneres will host the oscars for a_second_time next_year , the academy announced friday . <end> <start> "we are thrilled to have ellen_degeneres host the oscars , " producers craig_zadan and neil_meron said in a statement . <end> <start> degeneres announced the news in a tweet : "it's official : i'm hosting the #oscars ! <end> <start> i'd like to thank @theacademy , my wife portia and , oh dear , there goes the orchestra .

<start> he sings , dances , acts on stage and screen , and he 's the `` sexiest man alive . '' <end> <start> hugh jackman does everything but standup comedy - and that 's why the first-time oscars host fulfills the academy 's promise to shake up the show in a way that 's as tough to predict as the winners . <end> <start> jackman was announced friday as the host of the 81st academy_awards , a marked departure from the academy 's standard of big-name comedians . <end> <start> jon stewart , who hosted in 2008 and 2006 , and ellen degeneres , the 2007 host , were the latest in a line of funny emcees since 1990 . <end> <start> billy crystal did it eight times , whoopi goldberg took on four , steve martin did it twice and david letterman and chris rock each had a shot . <end> <start> as the parade of a-list comedians continued , ratings were in steady decline . <end> <start> but with new producers , a new director , new set designer and even a new music director , the academy has been hinting for months at an all-new look and feel for this year 's oscars telecast on feb. 22 . <end> <start> having jackman host certainly fits with that theme . <end> <start> producers laurence mark and bill condon called the australian actor `` a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star . '' <end> <start> `` he also has style , elegance and a sense of occasion , '' mark and condon said in a joint statement . <end> <start> `` hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year 's movies - and to have fun doing it . '' <end> <start> indeed , jackman can be a mutant superhero ( wolverine from the `` x-men '' movie franchise ) , a flirtatious singing barker ( billy bigelow in rodgers and hammerstein 's musical `` carousel '' ) , a determined magician ( `` the prestige '' ) and a dancing penguin ( `` happy feet '' ) . <end> <start> the 40-year-old actor plays a roughhewn cattle driver opposite nicole kidman 's english aristocrat in the new baz luhrmann romantic adventure `` australia . '' <end> <start> jackman was abroad promoting the film friday when his oscar role was announced . <end> <start> `` thirty years ago when i was in sydney watching johnny carson host the oscars with my family , i never imagined that i 'd one day have the chance to be up on that stage myself , '' he said in a statement . <end> <start> `` i am very grateful to the academy for giving me this opportunity . <end> <start> and , excited to be working with larry and bill on what i know will be a fun and memorable celebration . '' <end> <start> having an entertainer such as jackman host the show necessitates a change in the well-established standard of opening the show with a jokes , said steve pond , author of the 2005 book `` the big show : high times and dirty dealings backstage at the academy awards . '' <end> <start> `` the tricky part is that while he 's charming , he 's not the kind of guy to go out there and deliver a comic monologue at the top of the show , '' pond said . <end> <start> `` he 's more comfortable with a song and dance , but is a song and dance at the top of the oscars what people want to see ? <end> <start> it 'll be tricky adopting what he does best to what works at the oscars . '' <end> <start> but with ratings dropping for all awards shows , it 's worth shaking things up to generate interest - and the academy awards telecast , which posted its lowest ratings ever in february , is n't the only one trying something new . <end> <start> the emmys added a category - best reality-show host - and divvied the show 's hosting duties among the five nominees . <end> <start> the results were disastrous: <end> <start> critics panned the format and the show was one of the least-watched emmys ever . <end> <start> the grammy awards spiced up its nominations earlier this month by trading its typical staid press conference for a glitzy , live concert special . <end> <start> ratings-wise , the hourlong show came in fourth among prime-time contenders , behind such dramas as nbc 's `` life '' and abc 's `` private practice . '' <end> <start> bringing in jackman to host the academy awards is `` a stretch for the oscars , but at this stage , it 's worth taking the risk , '' pond said . <end> <start> `` he certainly has what it takes to do the gig if some changes are made in what that gig requires . '' <end> <start> jackman also has award-winning hosting experience: <end> <start> he won an emmy in 2005 for hosting the 58th annual tony awards in 2004 , when he also took a best-actor tony for his performance in the musical `` the boy from oz . <end> <start> `` jackman has never been an oscar nominee , but was nominated for a golden globe for his role in 2001 's romantic film `` kate and leopold .

<start> if only he 'll wear those gold lame pants . <end> <start> as word got_out friday that hugh_jackman will be this_year 's oscar host , a clip from the 2004 tony telecast of his performance from `` the_boy_from_oz '' made_the_rounds . <end> <start> if you happened to miss the 2004 tonys , jackman , playing the flamboyant australian songwriter peter allen , sang , danced and writhed his way across the stage in a leopard skin top and skin-tight gold lame pants . <end> <start> will the oscar gift baskets include smelling salts ? <end> <start> jackman , who has hosted the tonys several times and won an emmy for doing so in 2005 , certainly knows how to hold a stage -- he won a tony for `` the boy from oz '' -- and by choosing him , first-time oscar producers laurence mark and bill condon are betting that broadway can do what comedy could not . <end> <start> previous hosts -- jon stewart , ellen degeneres , chris rock -- all followed the traditional stand-up model and the ratings have steadily soured . <end> <start> obviously a change is required , and though i would lean toward thinking `` television '' rather than `` broadway '' ( why , i even wrote a piece about it , for this coming sunday 's calendar , before the host choice was announced ) , jackman is , of course , another way to go . <end> <start> clearly mark and condon are less concerned with solving the ratings crisis as they are with creating a new vibe for the show . <end> <start> jackman may have more talent in his little finger than most of us do in our entire bodies , but he does n't have the fan base of degeneres or rock . <end> <start> if you are among the thousands who loved his hosting of the tonys , you 're probably not only watching the oscars anyway , you 're hosting your own annual oscar party . <end> <start> yes , jackman was just named people 's sexiest man alive , and yes , he is wolverine of `` x-men '' but do we want wolverine hosting the oscars ? <end> <start> probably not . <end> <start> otherwise , jackman 's movie career has been less than memorable , capped by this year 's box office dud `` australia . '' <end> <start> and as last season 's mercifully short-lived `` viva laughlin '' proved , one talented person does not a television show make . <end> <start> or at least not a good television show . <end> <start> but mark and condon are the team that brought us `` dreamgirls , '' which actually makes jackman an obvious choice . <end> <start> there 's nothing wrong with a big broadway-esque opener similar to billy crystal 's famous musical clips , but with more hip action . <end> <start> beyond that , however , it gets a little worrisome . <end> <start> the oscars have a prickly relationship with singin ' and dancin ' and as anyone who saw rosie o'donnell 's recent disaster knows , nothing fails bigger than a failed variety show . <end> <start> what jackman does have in his favor is an unapologetic , unabashed love for , and understanding of , theater . <end> <start> he is n't snarky and he is n't an outsider . <end> <start> he is a from-the-bottom-of-his-heart performer who seems utterly happy and at ease in front of an audience . <end> <start> no doubt those in the kodak will enjoy an energetic and dazzling evening . <end> <start> how it will play on television remains to be seen . <end> <start> but maybe it 's time we stopped caring about that so much . <end>

" <end> <start> when the saints ( 11 - 5 ) open the playoffs in seattle ( 7 - 9 ) on saturday , the only remaining healthy running backs from their regular season roster will be reggie bush and julius jones . <end> <start> "naturally , i'm going to have to step up , " bush said . <end> <start> bush missed eight games with a fracture in his lower right leg . <end> <start> he has rushed for only 150 yards and has not scored a rushing touchdown this season , but started to look stronger on sunday against tampa bay , when he had 70 yards rushing on just nine carries and had 55 yards receiving on five catches . <end> <start> jones has 193 yards and no touchdowns on the ground . <end> <start> the only other running backs on the roster are fourth - year pro deshawn wynn , who was signed on tuesday but also was with the saints during the preseason , and rookie joique bell , who was signed wednesday from the philadelphia eagles' practice squad . <end> <start> brees said he remained optimistic that the versatility of the saints' offense and the way they spread the ball among so many players will allow them to weather such injuries perhaps better than most teams . <end> <start> "in the end , you just work to the strengths of the guys that you have . <end> <start> you don't worry about what you don't have , just what you have , " brees said . <end> <start> "while you would love to have all of the guys and all of the elements that they bring , i feel like reggie bush can do some pretty special stuff and julius jones can do some pretty special stuff . <end> <start> deshawn wynn , when called upon , can do the job . <end> <start> you realize that the passing game may have to pick up some slack at times depending on how the game plan changes by having those guys in . " <end> <start> bush , who returned from his broken right fibula on thanksgiving , said he has been feeling stronger lately and is looking forward to the chance to be the primary running back . <end> <start> however , he stressed that the success of the offense would hinge on many more factors than him . <end> <start> "it's about a team effort . <end> <start> it's not just about one person , " bush said . <end> <start> "we have some mistakes that we made as a team throughout the season on offense , defense and special teams that we've got to clean up . <end> <start> the running back position is just one small piece of the puzzle .

" <end> <start> for mr . gigante , the guise that he adopted in the mid - 1960's - behavior that won him the nickname oddfather - took considerable effort to maintain . <end> <start> he could often be seen shuffling around his greenwich village neighborhood in pajamas , bathrobe and slippers , mumbling to himself and appearing to be a disturbed but harmless person . <end> <start> law - enforcement agents , prosecutors and mafia defectors described his behavior as a staged performance calculated to evade prosecution for his activities as head of a crime family that under his leadership became the wealthiest and most powerful in the nation . <end> <start> based on information from informers and electronic eavesdropping on gangsters , f . b . i . and new york city law - enforcement officials ranked mr . gigante as the pre - eminent mafia leader in the early and mid - 1990's , and prosecutors identified him as the dominant force in the early 1990's inside the commission , the mafia's ruling body , which resolves significant disputes among the five major families in the new york region . <end> <start> his reach , law - enforcement officials said , extended as well to philadelphia and new england , where he exercised veto power over the appointments of mob bosses in those areas . <end> <start> salvatore gravano , the no . 2 figure in the gambino crime family before he defected in 1991 , testified that even mr . gigante's archrival , john gotti , grudgingly acknowledged mr . gigante's craftiness . <end> <start> "he's crazy like a fox , " mr . gravano quoted mr . gotti as saying of mr . gigante after a summit meeting of new york city mob leaders in 1988 . <end> <start> mr . gotti was the boss of the gambino family until his own imprisonment forced him to relinquish undisputed control in the late 1990's . <end> <start> he , too , died in a prison hospital , of cancer in june 2002 . <end> <start> federal bureau of investigation agents and federal and state prosecutors regarded mr . gigante as the most elusive mafia leader of his era and the most difficult to bring to trial . <end> <start> "he was probably the most clever organized - crime figure i have ever seen , " said john s . pritchard 3rd , a former f . b . i . supervisor , who led a squad that investigated the genovese family in the 1980's . <end> <start> disputing the government's contentions , mr . gigante's lawyers and relatives maintained that he had been mentally disabled since the late 1960's , with a below - normal i . q . of 69 to 72 . <end> <start> his defenders steadfastly denied that he was associated with the mafia , asserting that it was ludicrous to believe that someone so mentally subpar was capable of heading a major crime organization . <end> <start> the rev . louis gigante , a roman catholic priest , former new york city councilman and a builder of low - income housing in the bronx , characterized the relentless investigations of his older brother as persecution by agents and prosecutors who were biased against italian - americans . <end> <start> organized - crime experts and mob turncoats said that mr . gigante was apparently willing to humiliate himself publicly as the price for escaping the long prison sentences that were being meted out to other mafia leaders . <end> <start> according to federal and state investigators , each of the family's 200 "made" or inducted soldiers and about 1 , 000 associates - the name for others who voluntarily cooperate in illegal activities but who are not sworn members - were obligated to funnel part of their loot to mr . gigante , as much as $100 million a year in the early 1990's . <end> <start> the family's fortune , the experts said , flowed largely from a vast network of bookmaking and loansharking rings and from extortions of construction companies in the new york city area seeking labor peace or sweetheart contracts from carpenters , teamsters and laborers' unions that were dominated by mr . gigante's lieutenants . <end> <start> mob deserters in the mid - 1990's testified in criminal and civil cases that the genovese gang's other lucrative enterprises included the control of cartels that rigged bids and inflated prices in the private garbage - hauling industries of new york city and westchester county ; kickbacks from shipping and trucking companies on the new jersey waterfront in exchange for labor peace ; protection payoffs from merchants at the fulton fish market ; and the control of many union jobs at the jacob k . javits convention center in manhattan . <end> <start> mr . gigante's influence even extended over the san gennaro street festival in little italy until a 1995 crackdown by new york city officials and federal prosecutors resulted in allegations that the genovese family operated gambling games at the festival , extorted payoffs from venders and pocketed thousands of dollars donated to a neighborhood church . <end> <start> in the 1980's , after the authorities said mr . gigante had assumed undisputed command of the genovese family , he conducted his activities in a starkly unorthodox fashion for a mafia leader . <end> <start> most days , in the early evening , mr . gigante , a hulking man who was about six feet tall and weighed 200 pounds , would emerge from his mother's walkup apartment building on sullivan street in greenwich village . <end> <start> sometimes dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas and sometimes wearing a windbreaker and shabby trousers and always accompanied by one or two bodyguards , he gingerly crossed the street to the triangle civic improvement association , a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters . <end> <start> inside , he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with men who agents said were his trusted confederates . <end> <start> after midnight , according to f . b . i . surveillance reports , he would be driven to a townhouse near park avenue at east 77th street , that was owned by olympia esposito , who was characterized by mr . gigante's lawyers as his common - law wife and the mother of three of his eight children , vincent , lucia and carmella esposito . <end> <start> f . b . i . agents , who in 1986 observed the townhouse from a nearby rooftop post , said that soon after arriving , mr . gigante would change into more elegant clothes , carry on conversations with associates , and read or watch television before retiring . <end> <start> about 9 or 10 the next morning , he would reappear in his shabby downtown clothes and be driven back to sullivan street or a nearby apartment occupied by his relatives at 505 laguardia place . <end> <start> "it was hard to understand what enjoyment he got out of being a mob boss , " said ronald goldstock , the former director of the new york state organized crime task force . <end> <start> "his only pleasure appeared to be the pure power he exercised . " <end> <start> vincent gigante ( pronounced ji - gant - tee ) was born on march 29 , 1928 , in new york city and grew up on the same streets in greenwich village where he would spend most of his adult life . <end> <start> he was one of five sons of salvatore gigante , a watchmaker , and yolanda gigante , a seamstress , both of whom had immigrated from naples . <end> <start> his mother usually addressed him as "cincenzo , " a diminutive of vincente , and his boyhood friends shortened that into his lifelong nickname , "chin . " <end> <start> a lackadaisical student , mr . gigante graduated from p . s . 3 , an elementary school in greenwich village and dropped out of textile high school in manhattan in the ninth grade . <end> <start> police detectives said that as a teen - ager , he became a prot�g� of vito genovese , who was a potent mafia leader in the united states and in italy from the 1930's to the 1960's and whose name still describes the organized - crime group he headed until his death in 1969 . <end> <start> the gang was founded in the 1930's by one of the nation's most notorious criminals , charles ( lucky ) luciano , who was deported to italy and who died in 1962 . <end> <start> mr . genovese is believed to have endeared himself to the gigantes when vincent was a boy with a loan to pay for surgery needed by mrs . gigante . <end> <start> between age 17 and 25 , mr . gigante was arrested seven times on an array of charges : receiving stolen goods , possession of an unlicensed handgun , auto theft , arson and bookmaking . <end> <start> most were dismissed or resolved by fines . <end> <start> his only jail sentence in that period was 60 days for a gambling conviction . <end> <start> when arrested in his early 20's , he listed his occupation as a tailor . <end> <start> but as a strapping youth with quick fists , he was better known as a prize fighter . <end> <start> mr . gigante , from age 16 to 19 , fought as a light heavyweight in clubs around town , winning 21 of 25 light - heavyweight bouts , according to nat fleischer's ring record book . <end> <start> club boxers in those days fought four - and six - round contests in neighborhood arenas , usually getting a percentage of the tickets they themselves sold . <end> <start> one of mr . gigante's managers was a greenwich village neighbor , thomas ( tommy ryan ) eboli , who later became the boss of the genovese family . <end> <start> former new york city detectives who were assigned to organized - crime intelligence units said that mr . gigante earned his mafia spurs as an enforcer in the 1950's . <end> <start> but his prominence in the underworld surged in 1957 , when mr . genovese wrested control of a mob family from frank costello , who had been a close friend of lucky luciano and meyer lansky and was one of the best - known underworld figures in america . <end> <start> mr . costello retired abruptly as a boss after a gunman grazed his scalp with a bullet in the vestibule of his apartment building on central park west . <end> <start> a doorman identified the 29 - year - old mr . gigante as the shooter , but mr . costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant and mr . gigante was acquitted in 1958 on charges of attempted murder . <end> <start> a year later , he was convicted with mr . genovese in manhattan on federal charges of heroin trafficking . <end> <start> mr . gigante , who listed his profession as the superintendent of a tenement on bleecker street , was sentenced to seven years in prison . <end> <start> the sentencing judge said he would have imposed a longer sentence but was swayed by a flood of letters from residents of greenwich village and little italy attesting to mr . gigante's good character and his work on behalf of juveniles . <end> <start> he was paroled after five years and detectives said that soon afterward he was promoted from soldier to the rank of capo , or captain , overseeing a group of mafia gangsters known as a crew , in greenwich village . <end> <start> although his headquarters was in lower manhattan and he spent his nights farther uptown , mr . gigante had a home in old tappan , n . j . , where he lived with his wife , the former olympia grippa , and their three daughters and two sons . <end> <start> they are yolanda fyfe , roseanne d'cola and rita gigante , and salvatore and andrew . <end> <start> in 1969 , he was indicted in new jersey on a charge of conspiracy to bribe the entire five - member old tappan police force to alert him to surveillance operations by law enforcement agencies . <end> <start> the accusation was dropped after mr . gigante's lawyers presented reports from psychiatrists that he was mentally unfit to stand trial . <end> <start> mafia informers and defectors said that mr . gigante gained control of the genovese family in a peaceful transition in the early 1980's when the group's acting boss , philip lombardo , stepped down because of ill health , and mr . gigante's main rival , anthony salerno , was imprisoned for life on racketeering charges . <end> <start> mr . salerno died in federal prison in 1992 . <end> <start> as a new godfather , mr . gigante quickly imposed extraordinary security measures . <end> <start> genovese soldiers and associates were forbidden to utter his name or nickname in conversations or telephone calls . <end> <start> when references to him had to be made , capos and soldiers would silently point to their chins or form the letter "c" with their fingers . <end> <start> mr . gigante was indicted in 1990 with 14 others on federal charges in brooklyn that they had conspired to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on multimillion - dollar contracts with the new york city housing authority to install windows . <end> <start> at his arraignment , he appeared in court in his familiar pajamas and bathrobe and a peaked cap . <end> <start> because of defense contentions that he was mentally and physically impaired , his case was severed from the other defendants and legal battles ensued for seven years over his competence to stand trial . <end> <start> a superseding indictment in 1993 brought more serious accusations against him . <end> <start> mr . gigante was charged with being the head of the genovese family and sanctioning the murders of six mobsters and conspiring to kill three others , including john gotti , the boss of the gambino family . <end> <start> mr . gigante , the indictment asserted , wanted mr . gotti eliminated because he had violated mafia protocol by arranging the assassination of the previous gambino boss , paul castellano , without seeking mr . gigante's approval . <end> <start> the evidence in both indictments stemmed mainly from deserters from the genovese and other mob families who entered the government's witness protection program . <end> <start> at sanity hearings in march 1996 , mr . gravano of the gambino family , and alphonse d'arco , the former acting boss of another new york mafia organization , the lucchese crime family , testified that mr . gigante was lucid during top - level mafia meetings and that he had acknowledged to other gangsters that his eccentric behavior was a pretense . <end> <start> mr . gigante's lawyers elicited testimony and reports from psychiatrists and psychologists that from 1969 to 1995 , he had been confined 28 times in hospitals for treatment of hallucinations and that he suffered from "dementia rooted in organic brain damage . " <end> <start> in august 1996 , judge eugene h . nickerson of federal district court in brooklyn ruled that mr . gigante was mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges . <end> <start> the judge found that at least until 1991 , mr . gigante had engaged in an "elaborate deception" with the help of his relatives to deceive psychiatrists about his condition . <end> <start> before the trial began , mr . gigante , who had open - heart surgery in 1988 , had another cardiac operation in december 1996 , putting his fitness to stand trial in doubt once again . <end> <start> mr . gigante had pleaded not guilty and had been free for years on $1 million bond . <end> <start> during the monthlong trial in 1997 , a gaunt - looking mr . gigante sat in a wheelchair , looking blankly into space as witnesses testified and lawyers argued . <end> <start> he did not testify . <end> <start> after three days of deliberations , the jury on july 25 , 1997 , convicted him on charges of running multimillion - dollar rackets as the genovese family chief and of conspiring unsuccessfully in the late 1980's to murder mr . gotti and a genovese family defector . <end> <start> but he was acquitted of ordering three other gangland slayings and the jury was deadlocked on accusations that he ordered four other murders . <end> <start> imposing a sentence of 12 years - instead of a possible maximum of 27 years - and a $1 . 25 million fine , judge jack b . weinstein of federal district court in brooklyn reflected in december 1997 on mr . gigante's career . <end> <start> "he is a shadow of his former self , " the judge said , "an old man finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny .

<start> vincent_'chin'_gigante , 77 , crime_boss <end> <start> december_20_,_2005 <end> <start> vincent_gigante , who died yesterday in_federal_prison at 77 , was the genovese crime family boss who for three_decades feigned lunacy to evade prosecution for crimes ranging from loan_sharking to murder to bribing the entire police_force of old_tappan_,_n_._j . <end> <start> he was known as "chin , " and his moniker was often invoked by denizens of the mafia underworld with a hand - to - chin gesture rather than a word , the better to foil police bugs . <end> <start> to the writers of headlines he was sometimes "daffy don" or "the oddfather" for his habit of walking the streets of the west village clad in a bathrobe , striped pyjamas , and slippers , while muttering incoherently . <end> <start> federal prosecutors claimed it was an act , but it was not until 2003 , after more than three decades of faking mental illness , that gigante admitted in court that he did it to avoid prosecution . <end> <start> his admission came as part of a plea deal on behalf of his son , andrew , also convicted of mob - related activities . <end> <start> for two decades , gigante was head of the genovese crime family , which emerged as the largest of the five new york mafia clans after decades of concerted federal prosecutions decimated its rivals . <end> <start> it was estimated that there were some 300 members of the family under his control . <end> <start> the genovese rackets included guaranteeing labor peace to firms in construction , garbage removal , and trucking ; extorting payoffs from companies doing business at the ports of newark and elizabeth ; various rackets at the fulton fish market and the jacob k . javits convention center ; contracts for window - installation in city housing , and the old standbys of bookmaking , loan - sharking , and narcotics . <end> <start> it was narcotics that first sent gigante to prison , in 1959 , when he received a five - year sentence after being caught conspiring to smuggle heroin from abroad . <end> <start> also sentenced in the case was the man who gave his name to the crime family , vito genovese . <end> <start> genovese ran his organization from behind bars while serving a 15 - year sentence . <end> <start> it was a similar ruse - maintaining control of the family while incarcerated by transmitting orders through his son , andrew - that was gigante's downfall . <end> <start> gigante was born in the bronx to parents who were immigrants from naples , italy . <end> <start> his father was a jewelry engraver , and his mother was a seamstress . <end> <start> born vincenzo , he was called "chin" for short , and his prominent chin probably helped the name stick . <end> <start> he put it to good use as a teenage boxer , winning 21 of 25 club fights . <end> <start> gigante was arrested several times from when he was 17 to 25 , for possession of an unlicensed handgun , gambling , bookmaking , grand larceny , and arson . <end> <start> two of his brothers , mario and ralph , were also identified as mafia soldiers , while another , louis , was a prominent catholic priest as well as a democratic politician in the bronx . <end> <start> in 1957 gigante was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of frank costello , then the head of what would be called the genovese family . <end> <start> he was acquitted despite the testimony of a doorman who claimed to have witnessed the crime ; costello himself claimed not to have seen his assailant , despite being shot at close range from the front . <end> <start> the shot had only "creased his head , " according to reports at the time . <end> <start> the prosecutor in the costello case claimed that gigante was "a young punk on the way up in the underworld who was chosen to kill costello to win his spurs . " <end> <start> if so , it seemed to have worked , despite his having missed . <end> <start> costello retired soon after , and genovese assumed control of the family , which had a history going back to lucky luciano . <end> <start> after serving five years on the 1959 heroin conviction , gigante resumed his life of crime . <end> <start> he first sought psychiatric help in 1966 , while under investigation for bribing new york city police . <end> <start> in 1970 , he was indicted for bribing the entire five - man police force of old tappan , n . j . , a small town in bergen county where he had moved . <end> <start> after he produced evidence that he was under psychiatric care at st . vincent's hospital in westchester , the court ruled that he was mentally incompetent to testify in the case . <end> <start> it was a pattern gigante would repeat in the coming decades , including committing himself several times when prosecutions threatened . <end> <start> gigante's immediate family supported him , especially louis , the glad - handing , cigar - smoking priest and builder of low - income housing , who told reporters his brother had paranoid schizophrenia , dementia , and alzheimer's disease . <end> <start> federal marshals serving him with a subpoena at his mother's sullivan street apartment house once found him standing under the shower , fully clothed , holding an umbrella . <end> <start> "vincenzo ? <end> <start> he is the boss of the toilet ! " <end> <start> his mother told new york post columnist cindy adams . <end> <start> gigante , meantime , was consolidating his power within the genovese family . <end> <start> in the late 1970s , he ran a crew in lower manhattan , operating waterfront rackets , as well as loan - sharking and gambling in new jersey . <end> <start> he emerged as head of the genovese family by the early 1980s . <end> <start> federal prosecutors kept him under observation for decades , and gigante kept up the crazy act with amazing consistency . <end> <start> he spent much of each day walking around the village in his bed clothes and playing cards at his triangle civic improvement association on mulberry street . <end> <start> a sign hung on the wall warning business associates against loose talk : "this place is bugged . " <end> <start> by the late 1980s , he rarely went to old tappan , preferring to spend his nights on the upper east side with his mistress , with whom he had three children . <end> <start> oddly , both his wife and his mistress were named olympia . <end> <start> gigante's mental illness act allowed him to escape trial despite being indicted numerous times on charges ranging from bid rigging and extortion to conspiracy to commit eight murders . <end> <start> his luck held until 1997 , when a new york jury found him guilty of a range of charges and sentenced him to 12 years in the federal penitentiary . <end> <start> it may have been a bad omen that the judge in the case , jack b . weinstein , insisted that gigante wear a suit rather than a bathrobe to his trial . <end> <start> at the palma boys social club in east harlem in 1985 , the fbi taped the following exchange between two genovese family members , anthony "fat tony" salerno and giuseppe sabato : <end> <start> salerno : he's got to worry if he gets pinched , all them years he spent in that [ expletive deleted ] asylum . <end> <start> sabato : that's what i'm saying . <end> <start> salerno : for nothing . <end> <start> vincent l . gigante <end> <start> born march 29 , 1928 , in the bronx ; died december 19 at the u . s . medical center for federal prisoners in springfield , mo . ; the cause of death was not announced , but he had recently suffered heart problems . <end>

<start> microsoft releases critical patch for ie zero day flaw <end> <start> microsoft ( nsdq : msft ) issued an out-of-band emergency patch wednesday for a zero-day internet_explorer vulnerability that has opened the door for hackers to install malware on susceptible computers without any user intervention . <end> <start> the flaw , which is given the highest severity rating of critical , affects all versions of microsoft 's ie web browser . <end> <start> specifically , microsoft 's ie update affects versions of windows_2000 for ie_5.01_:_xp , xp_professional , server_2003 for ie_6 ; and xp , server_2003 , vista , server_2008 for ie_7 . <end> <start> the vulnerability was reported after the release of windows ie 8 beta 2 , but microsoft still recommends in its advisory that users apply the patch . <end> <start> the ie security problem is the result of a fundamental flaw in the browser 's data binding function , which ultimately leaves a hole in the memory space that can be accessed by remote hackers . <end> <start> internet explorer can then quit unexpectedly while in an exploitable state . <end> <start> unlike other exploits , users have only to visit a malicious site infused with trojans or other malware in order to become infected . <end> <start> hackers can also entice victims to visit a specially crafted site , usually via some kind of phishing or social engineering scheme , or place infected banner ads on legitimate web sites . <end> <start> once users open an infected web page , malicious downloaders are then installed on their computers , which are designed to record keystrokes and steal passwords , credit card numbers , or other financial information . <end> <start> the users ' computer could also become part of a botnet , an infected network of compromised computers , operated by a central command and control center . <end> <start> security researchers first saw evidence of attacks exploiting the ie vulnerability last week , shortly following microsoft 's `` patch tuesday '' monthly security bulletin release dec. 9 . <end> <start> since then , researchers have seen active exploitation rapidly spread in the wild . <end> <start> while exact numbers of victims are difficult to precisely calculate , the number of infected computers could potentially affect hundreds of thousands or millions of computers , experts say . <end> <start> `` there 're people constantly looking at the code , trying to find issues like ( the ie vulnerability ) , '' said dave marcus , security research and communications manager for mcafee . <end> <start> `` it gets posted to the internet very quickly . '' <end> <start> mcafee avert labs researchers reported variants of the ie exploit that attempt to infect users via an activex control that stores the malicious exploit code , stealthily running in the background of a microsoft word document . <end> <start> malware is then installed on the vulnerable computer once users open up a word document -- all without their knowledge or permission . <end> <start> `` we 've seen some pretty clever ways of people trying to take advantage of this , '' said marcus . <end> <start> `` it just speaks to the fact that they look for clever , very unique ways to get malware onto your system . '' <end> <start> security experts strongly recommend that users apply microsoft 's latest ie patch as soon as possible , which can be downloaded from the microsoft web site . <end>
<start> september_18th_,_2013_,_05_:_31_gmt <end> <start> microsoft launches emergency_patch for internet_explorer <end> <start> microsoft has just released a new security_update for internet_explorer in order to patch a flaw affecting all versions of the company ’ s in_-_house browser , including ie11 on windows_8 . 1 rtm . <end> <start> while microsoft claims that it has received reports of attacks aimed at internet_explorer_8 and 9 , it appears that the security_flaw affects all the other versions of the browser . <end> <start> according to the company , the issue would allow remote code_execution , which means that an attacker could get access to an unpatched system by directing users to a compromised website . <end> <start> “ this issue could allow remote code_execution if an affected system browses to a website containing malicious content directed towards the specific browser type . <end> <start> this would typically occur when an attacker compromises the security of trusted websites regularly frequented , or convinces someone to click on a link in an email or instant message , ” the company explained . <end> <start> the fix_it_tool released by microsoft can be used for ie6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 on windows_xp , vista , 7_,_8_,_and_8_._1 , both preview and rtm . 32 - and 64 - bit versions of the operating_systems are all included in the security advisory . <end> <start> in addition , the tech_giant recommends users to set internet and local intranet security zone settings to “ high ” in order to block activex controls and active scripting in these zones . <end> <start> “ this will help prevent exploitation but may affect usability ; therefore , trusted sites should be added to the internet_explorer trusted sites zone to minimize disruption , ” microsoft said . <end> <start> at the same time , the softies suggest that it would be a good idea to configure internet_explorer to prompt before running active scripting or to disable active scripting completely in the internet and local intranet security zones , just to be sure that everyone is on_the_safe_side and no successful attacks are possible . <end>

'' <end> <start> the ie software patch will be automatically applied to hundreds of millions of personal computers due to standard update settings in the machines , according to microsoft security response alliance director mike reavey . <end> <start> wednesday morning , business networks using ie began getting the critical fix through routine patching processes . <end> <start> reavey said microsoft went into `` emergency response '' mode on december 9 after it first learned of the attacks on ie browsers . <end> <start> a day later , microsoft published a security advisory that `` listed workarounds that blocked all known attacks . '' <end> <start> `` over the course of the next eight days , this advisory was updated five times , adding newer workarounds and mitigations , '' reavey said . <end> <start> `` we also continually monitored the threat environment , noting when the attacks began to change in nature and scope . '' <end> <start> trend micro has identified about 10,000 websites that have been infected with malicious software that can be surreptitiously slipped into visitors ' unprotected ie browsers to take advantage of the flaw . <end> <start> a major internet portal in taiwan is among the legitimate websites unknowingly tainted with malicious software aimed at ie 's weak spot , according to ferguson . <end> <start> hackers can take control of infected computers , steal data , redirect browsers to dubious websites , and use machines for devious activities such as attacks on other networks , according to security specialists . <end> <start> `` what makes this so insidious is it takes advantage of a big gaping hole of ie , which has the largest install base of any browser on the market , '' ferguson said . <end> <start> ie is used on nearly three-quarters of the world 's computers , according to industry statistics from november . <end> <start> reavey said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half-a-dozen versions of ie in scores of languages . <end> <start> analyst rob enderle of enderle group in silicon valley said it was `` amazing '' that microsoft was able to turn out a complex critical fix in a week when such jobs typically can take a month or longer of intense work . <end> <start> `` even with that , the release emergency response process is n't over , '' reavey said . <end> <start> `` there is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . '' <end> <start> trend micro urges ie users to heed precautionary advice from microsoft , or avoid using the browsers , until the patches are applied . <end> <start> the `` exploit '' is similar to one used recently to steal user names , passwords and other information from people playing online games in china , according to trend micro . <end>
<start> microsoft releases security_patch for internet_explorer <end> <start> reuters_sep_18_,_2013_,_02_._16pm_ist <end> <start> microsoft released an emergency software_fix for internet_explorer on_tuesday after hackers exploited a security_flaw in the popular web browser to attack an unknown number of users . <end> <start> the software_maker said on its website it released the software , known as a "fix_it , " as an emergency measure to protect customers after learning about "extremely limited , targeted attacks" that made_use_of the newly discovered bug . <end> <start> microsoft said the attacks took_advantage_of an undiscovered flaw , or "zero_day" vulnerability in industry parlance . <end> <start> state - sponsored hacking_groups are often willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for zero_-_day_vulnerabilities in widely used software such as internet_explorer , according_to security_experts who track that market . <end> <start> they typically use them on small numbers of carefully selected , high - value targets , to keep such flaws secret . <end> <start> once microsoft issues_a_warning about a zero_-_day bug , other groups_of_hackers involved_in massive cyber_-_crime_operations , such as identity theft , rush to reverse_-_engineer the fix_its so they can build computer viruses that also exploit the same vulnerabilities . <end> <start> security_experts said internet explorer users should either immediately install the fix it or stop using the browser until microsoft can put_out an update , which will be automatically installed through its windows_update program . <end> <start> "with the fix_it out , i'm sure any attacker who is a bit sophisticated can figure_out what the flaw is and implement a similar exploit in their own attack toolkit , " said wolfgang_kandek , chief technology officer with the cybersecurity firm qualys_inc . <end> <start> "fix_its" are pieces of software for remediating security flaws that must be downloaded and installed on pcs . <end> <start> they are designed to protect customers while microsoft prepares official updates , automatically delivered via the internet to be installed on computers . <end> <start> kandek said he expects microsoft to push_out an update to address the issue within_two_to_three_weeks . <end> <start> the fix_it can be installed by clicking on a link this page on microsoft's support site <end>
<start> microsoft releases emergency patch for ie <end> <start> microsoft has released an emergency patch to fix a software flaw that allows hackers to get_into internet_explorer browsers and take_over computers . <end> <start> the head of microsoft 's security response team says all users of internet explorer should test and install the update as soon as possible . <end> <start> experts say without the emergency patch , the flaw could allow criminals to take control of computers and steal users ' passwords even when they are not downloading material . <end> <start> microsoft says less than 1 per cent of australian pc users have been affected by the problem . <end>
<start> microsoft issues emergency patch to curb password-stealing hackers <end> <start> microsoft today issued an emergency update to plug a critical security hole present in all versions of its internet_explorer web browser , a flaw that hackers have been leveraging to steal data from millions of windows users . <end> <start> the patch , which microsoft dubbed ms08-078 , fixes a security vulnerability that microsoft says already has been used to attack more than 2 million windows users . <end> <start> as security fix and other members of the tech community have chronicled , attackers have been busy compromising thousands of web sites by seeding them with code that installs password-stealing software on computer systems of web site visitors who use internet explorer . <end> <start> microsoft estimated monday that one in every 500 windows users had been exposed to sites that try to exploit the flaw . <end> <start> additionally , it said the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 percent daily . <end> <start> vulnerability management company ncircle said microsoft 's decision to issue the patch outside of its normal patch tuesday ( second tuesday of each month ) cycle is wise , given the current exploitation of the flaw and because instructions for exploiting the flaw are now available online . <end> <start> `` given the ongoing attacks for this bug and because the technical details have been available to the public for over a week , this is clearly a high risk client side vulnerability that everyone should patch now , '' said andrew storms , director of security for ncircle . <end> <start> this is an urgent update . <end> <start> if you use windows , apply this patch now . <end> <start> windows users can download the fix at windows update , or by enabling automatic updates . <end>
<start> with web attacks increasing , microsoft fixes ie bug <end> <start> security experts say that web surfers should immediately install a new bug-fix for microsoft 's internet explorer browser , released wednesday morning . <end> <start> the flaw , which was accidentally made public by chinese security researchers just over a week ago , has been used in a growing number of web-based attacks over the past few days . <end> <start> criminals have posted attack code that exploits this flaw on thousands of web sites so far , according to rick howard , intelligence director with verisign 's idefense group . <end> <start> verisign has now seen six variants of the attack software , all of which attempt to steal chinese online gaming credentials . <end> <start> often the attack is launched through a hidden iframe component that is surreptitiously put on a web site . <end> <start> verisign has even spotted one such iframe attack on a legitimate financial institution 's web site , howard said . <end> <start> `` the volume of iframes deploying this thing is really high . '' <end> <start> the flaw lies in the way internet explorer 's data-binding function works , microsoft said . <end> <start> when the browser is attacked it will crash , corrupting the computer 's memory and allowing the criminal to run unauthorized software . <end> <start> view more related contentview all related articles <end> <start> because internet explorer is used by about 70 percent of web surfers , this attack code will probably show up in widely used malicious software toolkits `` very shortly , '' howard said . <end> <start> other security companies agreed with verisign 's assessment . <end> <start> `` microsoft 's latest ie out-of-band patch release needs to be installed right away , '' said shavlik_technologies in a statement . <end> <start> `` the number of infected web sites is growing at an alarming rate -- even people visiting legitimate web sites are getting hacked with this exploit . '' <end> <start> the flaw is so serious , in fact , that microsoft took the unusual step of issuing its security fix weeks ahead of schedule . <end> <start> typically microsoft releases security patches just once a month in order to simplify the lives of system administrators . <end> <start> its next set of updates is due jan. 13 . <end> <start> criminals could also launch their attacks via e-mail , by sending victims maliciously encoded html documents , although this type of attack has not been reported . <end> <start> microsoft 's patch is for users of ie version 5 and up . <end>
<start> microsoft releases patch for critical ie security flaw <end> <start> microsoft released a critical security patch on wednesday to plug vulnerabilities in internet_explorer , a move that comes amid malicious attackers taking_advantage of the security flaws . <end> <start> the patch is designed to prevent attackers from downloading malware onto users ' computers if they visit a malicious web site , or a legitimate web site that has been infected . <end> <start> this zero-day exploit has been in circulation since the first week of december and potentially could have infected a wide swath of users . <end> <start> the vulnerabilities are found in not only ie 7 , microsoft 's latest browser , but also internet explorer 5.01 , internet explorer 6 , and internet explorer 6 service pack 1 . <end>
<start> microsoft releases critical internet explorer patch <end> <start> the out-of-band security update fixes a javascript-related vulnerability that 's being actively exploited through hacked web sites . <end> <start> microsoft ( nsdq : msft ) has released an out-of-band security update , ms08-078 , to fix a vulnerability in its internet_explorer web browser that 's being actively exploited . <end> <start> `` at this time , we are aware only of attacks that attempt to use this vulnerability against windows internet explorer 7 , '' said christopher budd , microsoft security response communications lead , in an e-mailed statement . <end> <start> `` our investigation of these attacks so far has verified that they are not successful against customers who have applied the security update . <end> <start> ms08-078 has a maximum severity rating of critical for all versions of internet explorer . '' <end> <start> on the heels of the yahoo deal that fell apart v 2 , comeback ceo jerry yang was skewered by the able hands of web 2.0 summit host john battelle . <end> <start> paul martino , ceo of aggregate knowledge , talks about the company 's `` online discovery '' tool , which essentially looks across hundreds of millions of web sites and recommends content , products , and services to users in real time . <end> <start> mashmaker allows developers to add a bit of javascript to any page and have that page automatically populated with appropriate widgets , making the page more useful for site visitors . <end> <start> nonetheless , microsoft lists internet explorer 5.01 , 6 , and 7 as affected software in its security bulletin . <end> <start> it also says separately , in the faq section , that internet explorer 8 beta 2 is affected . <end> <start> the vulnerability can be exploited through javascript code posted on malicious web sites . <end> <start> internet explorer users may be redirected to these sites through hacked legitimate sites . <end> <start> if the malicious code is successful , it silently downloads malware onto the victim 's computer . <end> <start> microsoft typically releases software patches , referred to as security bulletins , on the second tuesday of every month . <end> <start> when critical vulnerabilities emerge and are actively exploited , microsoft often issues a patch as soon as it 's ready . <end> <start> the last such out-of-band patch , microsoft security bulletin ms08-067 , was released on oct. 23 . <end> <start> it addressed a vulnerability in windows server service that affected all currently supported versions of windows . <end> <start> that vulnerability allowed an attacker to take over affected computers remotely . <end> <start> when microsoft issued its out-of-band patch in october , it cited the vulnerability 's potential `` wormability '' -- meaning the hole could be exploited on a massive scale using self-copying malware -- as a reason for its action . <end> <start> but ms08-078 is n't wormable . <end> <start> `` that shows that the wormability of a vulnerability is no longer a good indicator of the seriousness of a threat and that these web-based threats are now much more dangerous than network worms , '' said roel schouwenberg , senior antivirus researcher for kaspersky lab , americas , in an e-mailed statement . <end> <start> indeed , microsoft security researchers estimated that as many as 1 in 500 users of internet explorer could have been exposed to malware attempting to exploit the flaw . <end> <start> `` the browser flaw had been disclosed roughly one week ago as a zero-day vulnerability , and active exploits have been around the internet for that timeframe as well , '' qualys cto wolfgang kandek said in an e-mailed statement . <end> <start> `` the workarounds provided by microsoft were very technical and quite cumbersome to implement , making it imperative for microsoft to release a fix as quickly as possible . '' <end> <start> kandek suggests that microsoft is at a disadvantage in updating internet explorer because its browser does n't have a built-in update mechanism like other browser makers . <end> <start> mozilla , for instance , just released firefox 3.05 to firefox users through its auto-update system . <end> <start> microsoft is urging users of ie to test and deploy this update as soon as possible . <end>

<start> microsoft releases out_-_of_-_cycle patch for ie_flaw <end> <start> published on 18th_september_2013 <end> <start> microsoft's bad september continues to grow worse , with the company being forced to issue an out_-_of_-_cycle patch for a zero_-_day vulnerability in its internet_explorer web browser . <end> <start> microsoft's september got off to a bad start when the company issued a raft of faulty updates as part of its monthly patch tuesday release cycle . <end> <start> while the issues have now been resolved , the company was forced to remove and re - release a total of ten patches - making it the worst patch tuesday in a six - month run that has seen only a single month go by without a show - stopping fault resulting in patches being reissued following customer complaints . <end> <start> today's admission from the company isn't going to do much to salve its public_image , either : microsoft has confirmed that a flaw in its internet_explorer web browser is being actively exploited in targeted attacks , and considers the issue serious enough to release an out_-_of_-_cycle fix ahead of next_month's_patch_tuesday . <end> <start> the update , which is only available for manual installation and will not be published through windows update , is a work - around rather than a true fix for a pretty serious flaw in microsoft's mshtml shim component - which had already been targeted in prior attacks at the start of the year . <end> <start> 'this issue could allow remote code execution if an affected system browses to a website containing malicious content directed towards the specific browser type , ' explained microsoft's dustin_childs in an alert to the security community . <end> <start> 'this would typically occur when an attacker compromises the security of trusted websites regularly frequented , or convinces someone to click on a link in an email or instant message . <end> <start> running modern versions of internet explorer ensures that customers receive the benefit of additional security features that can help prevent successful attacks , ' he added - but while the current targeted attacks are only being pointed at the outdated internet explorer 8 and internet explorer 9 releases , it is thought the flaw could exist across all versions of ie . <end> <start> for those who use internet explorer , microsoft's advice is to install the out - of - cycle fix - it patch to work around the issue until a proper solution can be found . <end> <start> the patch applies to all version of internet explorer from ie 6 through to the latest ie 11 , although is only designed to resolve the issue with the 32 - bit version - the 64 - bit version , it would seem , being better protected against the vulnerability . <end> <start> with microsoft's recent track record for patches causing problems worse than they solve , however , users would be well advised to test the patch on a virtual machine or similar throw - away system before rolling it out on a wider scale . <end>
<start> critical ie patch now available : go get it ! <end> <start> in thursday 's it blogwatch , richi jennings watches bloggers watch microsoft 's latest out-of-cycle , critical patch for internet explorer . <end> <start> not to mention portability , 1980 's style ... <end> <start> as it promised [ tuesday ] , microsoft_corp. today issued an emergency patch to plug a critical hole in internet_explorer ( ie ) that attackers have been increasingly exploiting from hacked web_sites . <end> <start> the patch , described in microsoft 's security bulletin ms08-078 , fixes a flaw in the data-binding function of all available versions of the popular browser , including ie5.01 , ie6 , ie7 and ie8 beta 2 . <end> <start> microsoft labeled the bug as `` critical , '' the most serious threat ranking in its four-step scoring system . <end> <start> according to both microsoft and numerous security firms , attacks have been mounting , particularly since last weekend , when hackers began hijacking legitimate web sites and launching exploits against unwary visitors . <end> <start> in fact , microsoft said it monitored a `` huge increase '' in attacks last saturday . <end> <start> the number of infected web sites , many of them legitimate , has grown at `` an alarming '' rate since the vulnerability was released into the wild and people need to do nothing but visit an infected site with a vulnerable browser to be affected . <end> <start> by friday , microsoft was aware users were becoming infected at a rate even faster than previous zero-day exploits . <end> <start> originally porn sites seemed to be the carriers , but the number of legit sites causing infections was skyrocketing . <end> <start> hackers were planting the exploit using well-known sql injection techniques . <end> <start> it is users ' turn to protect themselves by installing this emergency patch and all all the others , and fast . <end> <start> since the bad guys were exploiting it before microsoft knew it existed , the exploit is termed `` zero day '' because that is how much notice microsoft got of the problem . <end> <start> it is also termed an `` drive-by '' exploit since a user could pick up a malware infestation by merely using ie to browse any of thousands of compromised websites . <end> <start> in short , it was really nasty stuff . <end> <start> brian krebs sounds worried: <end> <start> microsoft estimated monday that one in every 500 windows users had been exposed to sites that try to exploit the flaw . <end> <start> additionally , it said the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 percent daily . <end> <start> this is an urgent update . <end> <start> if you use windows , apply this patch now . <end> <start> microsoft 's mike reavey grabs the mic: <end> <start> this update will be applied automatically to hundreds of millions of customers through automatic updates over the next few days . <end> <start> and , for our enterprise customers - with multiple systems within their networks - this update can be deployed through all standard security update management systems including , sccm , sms , wsus , and windows update <end> <start> this update meets the quality , deployment and application compatibility criteria . <end> <start> it is a high-quality update , ready for broad release , and we encourage customers to test and deploy this update as quickly as possible . <end> <start> we were able to share detailed information with our partners in the microsoft active protections program ( mapp ) and microsoft security response alliance ( msra ) , allowing protections to be created for over 24 different security partners ' products . <end> <start> this is further validation of our commitment to 'community based defense ' and means customers that ... were n't even using microsoft products , were also protected from known attacks . <end> <start> ed oswald is impressed by microsoft 's speed: <end> <start> well , that was quick . <end> <start> it 's pretty bad when security experts are telling your customers to switch . <end> <start> these are unbiased ( for the most part ) folks , and the typical computer user is going to take their advice seriously . <end> <start> but tiny dancer ... well , not so much: <end> <start> eight days is rather shamefully long to have to wait for a potentially devastating vulnerability to be fixed . <end> <start> this ai n't hanukkah , microsoft , and you ai n't no maccabee . <end>
<start> hackers exploit critical_ie_bug ; microsoft promises patch <end> <start> ie6 through ie11 harbor vulnerability , but in - the - wild attacks limited to ie8 and ie9 <end> <start> september_17_,_2013_03_:_16_pm_et <end> <start> computerworld - microsoft today said that hackers are exploiting a critical , but unpatched , vulnerability in internet_explorer_8_(_ie8 ) and internet_explorer_9_(_ie9 ) , and that its engineers are working on an update to plug the hole . <end> <start> as it often does , the company downplayed the threat . <end> <start> "there are only reports of a limited number of targeted attacks specifically directed at internet_explorer_8 and 9 , although the issue could potentially affect all supported versions , " dustin_childs , a manager in the trustworthy computing group and its usual spokesman , said in a blog post tuesday_morning . <end> <start> "we are actively working to develop a security update to address this issue , " childs added . <end> <start> according_to childs and the security_advisory microsoft also published today , the vulnerability affects all supported versions of ie , from the 12 - year - old ie6 to the not - yet - officially - released ie11 , the browser that will accompany windows 8 . 1 when it ships oct_._18 . <end> <start> "there is no escaping this one , " said andrew_storms , director of devops at cloud security vendor cloudpassage , referring to the bug affecting all versions of microsoft's browser . <end> <start> "ie zero_-_days are never a good_thing , especially when they affect every version , " storms added . <end> <start> although microsoft's advisory did not put it in these terms , the vulnerability can be exploited using classic "drive - by" attack tactics . <end> <start> that means hackers need only lure victims running ie to malicious sites - - or legitimate websites that have previously been compromised and loaded with attack code - - to hijack their browser and plant malware on their windows pcs . <end> <start> until microsoft produces a patch , the company offered customers several options to protect themselves , including advice on configuring emet_4_._0 and running one of its "fixit" automated tools to "shim" the dll that contains the ie rendering_engine . <end> <start> emet ( enhanced mitigation experience toolkit ) is a tool designed for advanced users , primarily enterprise it professionals , that manually enables anti - exploit technologies such as aslr ( address space layout randomization ) and dep ( data execution prevention ) for specific applications . <end> <start> but the fixit route will be easiest for individual users : microsoft's posted a link to the fixit tool on its support site , and customers need only click the icon marked "enable . " <end> <start> microsoft has used the shim approach before when faced with unexpected attacks against ie . <end> <start> based on past practice , microsoft's fixit workaround probably uses the application compatibility toolkit to modify the core library of ie - - a dll ( dynamic link library ) named "mshtml . dll" that contains the browser's rendering engine - - in memory each time ie runs . <end> <start> the shim does not quash the bug , but instead makes the browser immune to the attacks microsoft's seen in the wild thus far . <end> <start> users can also temporarily ditch ie for an alternate browser , such as google's chrome or mozilla's firefox , to stay safe until microsoft comes up with a permanent fix . <end> <start> microsoft today declined say when it plans to patch the ie vulnerability . <end> <start> but because the next regularly_-_scheduled patch_tuesday is three_weeks_away , it's possible the redmond_,_wash_._company's security_team will deliver a so_-_called "out_-_of_-_band" update before_oct_._9 . <end> <start> out - of - band updates from microsoft are rare : the last one it shipped was ms13 - 008 , an the emergency patch issued jan_._14 that plugged a hole in ie6 , ie7 and ie8 that had been exploited since_early_december_2012 . <end>
<start> microsoft releases security update for internet explorer <end> <start> microsoft has released an emergency security update to fix the vulnerability in internet_explorer that has seen the computers of at least two million users hacked . <end> <start> the `` zero day '' flaw allows hackers to gain access to the computers of visitors to infected websites , jeopardising the security of passwords , bank details and other personal information . <end> <start> it is believed that as many as 233,000 web pages have been affected . <end> <start> microsoft says its `` critical '' update will protect users . <end> <start> christopher budd , of the software giant 's security centre , said the company `` encourages all internet explorer customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible '' . <end> <start> mike reavey , also from the security centre , said : `` even with that , the release emergency response process is n't over . <end> <start> there is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . '' <end> <start> microsoft has said that the flaw has been proven to exist only in version 7 of internet explorer , but that version 6 and the `` beta '' release of version 8 are also `` potentially vulnerable '' . <end> <start> it has estimated that one in every 500 windows users has been exposed to websites that attempt to exploit the flaw , and that the number of victims was increasing by 50 per cent every day . <end> <start> paul ferguson , a researcher from the software security company trend micro , told the bbc that attacks were spreading `` like wildfire '' . <end> <start> `` this vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day , '' mr ferguson said . <end>
<start> microsoft rushes emergency fix to address internet_explorer attacks <end> <start> september_17_,_2013_4_:_16_pm_et <end> <start> microsoft has rushed_out a temporary fix to address ongoing attacks targeting an internet_explorer zero_-_day_vulnerability . <end> <start> the software_giant said the fix_-_it_temporary_workaround should be effective in preventing a successful attack . <end> <start> the company said the vulnerability impacts all currently supported versions_of_the_browser , but attacks have been limited to users of internet_explorer_8 and internet_explorer_9 . <end> <start> "on completion of this investigation , microsoft will take the appropriate action to protect our customers , which may include providing a solution through our monthly security update release process , or an out - of - cycle security update , depending on customer needs , " the company said in a security advisory issued tuesday . <end> <start> "in addition , we are actively working with partners to monitor the threat_landscape and take_action_against malicious sites that attempt to exploit this vulnerability . " <end> <start> the fact that microsoft is rushing_out a patch so quickly indicates the threat is serious , said paul_henry , security and forensic analyst at lumension . <end> <start> cybercriminals can set_up drive - by attack campaigns or lure victims to a website hosting malware that targets the coding error . <end> <start> "this seems to be perfectly positioned for drive - by malware using compromised websites , " henry told crn . <end> <start> "since these are targeted attacks , someone is restricting use of it ; they don't want information about this out in the wild because they want to be able to profit from it or use it in nation_-_state attacks . " <end> <start> the attack is very targeted and limited to japan , according to wolfgang kandek , chief technology officer of qualys . <end> <start> "it might not affect you at the moment . <end> <start> but with the publication of the shim , other attackers can now analyze the condition fixed and will be able to produce an equivalent exploit fairly quickly , " kandek wrote in a blog post about the issue . <end> <start> "we suggest applying the fix - it as soon as possible if you use ie to access the internet . " <end> <start> the flaw stems from an error in the way the browser accesses an object in memory that has been deleted or has not been properly allocated . <end> <start> the coding error results in memory corruption , giving an attacker the ability to execute code in the context of the current user within internet explorer , microsoft said . <end> <start> as part of its september 2013 patch tuesday updates , microsoft repaired 47 vulnerabilities , including 10 critical flaws in internet explorer . <end>
<start> microsoft issues emergency patch for internet explorer <end> <start> microsoft has issued an emergency patch for its internet_explorer browser , aiming to fix a critical flaw that allowed hackers to take_over computers merely by steering them to infected websites . <end> <start> microsoft wednesday took the rare step of issuing the patch after numerous security experts advised people to switch to rival browsers until microsoft fixed the problem . <end> <start> microsoft usually releases patches on a set schedule and this is only the third emergency patch in the last three years . <end> <start> the flaw has been in circulation since the first week of december . <end> <start> so far , more than two million computers are believed to have been infected , according to pc magazine . <end> <start> the vulnerabilities are found on copies of internet explorer 7 , as well as ie6 and ie5 . <end> <start> the patch is designed to prevent attackers from downloading malware onto users ' computers if they visit a malicious web site , or a legitimate web site that has been infected . <end>
<start> microsoft issues patch to fix ie bug <end> <start> september_19_,_2013 <end> <start> microsoft has reportedly issued a patch to fix a previously unknown vulnerability in its internet_explorer ( ie ) web browser . <end> <start> the software_manufacturer said that the bug , related to the browser's memory , could affect all versions of ie6_to_10 as hackers could set_up websites to exploit the vulnerability and run malicious_code on users' computers . <end> <start> according_to the bbc , microsoft's dustin_childs advised users to set internet and local security_zone settings to 'high' to block activex_controls and active_scripting apart from adding sites they trust to the ie trusted_sites_zone . <end> <start> microsoft's fix_it patch applies only to 32 - bit versions of ie and is not being rolled_out automatically and it is not intended to be a replacement for scheduled security updates . <end> <start> director at security company trusteer , dana_tamir said that the patch is a temporary workaround , like applying a band_-_aid to a wound . <end> <start> users have complained that they were repeatedly receiving update installation messages even after they had already done so , the report added . <end>
<start> microsoft patches major ie bug <end> <start> in_record_time , microsoft released today an `` out of band '' patch for a significant security flaw in internet_explorer that burst_onto_the_scene 8_days_ago . <end> <start> we strongly recommend that all windows users , especially windows xp and windows 2000 users , apply the patch as soon as possible . <end> <start> it is available on windows update and through automatic updates and by direct download through the security advisory for the vulnerability . <end> <start> here is the description of the vulnerability that it presents: <end> <start> a remote code execution vulnerability exists as an invalid pointer reference in the data binding function of internet explorer . <end> <start> when data binding is enabled ( which is the default state ) , it is possible under certain conditions for an object to be released without updating the array length , leaving the potential to access the deleted object 's memory space . <end> <start> this can cause internet explorer to exit unexpectedly , in a state that is exploitable . <end> <start> that 's not quite enough to help you to write an exploit , but it 's a lot more detail than they usually release . <end> <start> once again , run , do n't walk , to your vulnerable pcs and apply these updates . <end>
<start> microsoft : ie zero_day_flaw affects all versions <end> <start> microsoft said today that attackers are exploiting a previously unknown , unpatched vulnerability in all supported versions of its internet_explorer web browser . <end> <start> the company said it is working_on an official patch to plug the security hole , but in the meantime it has released a stopgap fix to help protect affected customers . <end> <start> microsoft said it is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit the vulnerability ( cve - 2013 - 3893 ) in ie_8 and ie_9 versions of the default windows browser . <end> <start> according_to an advisory issued today , the flaw is a remote code bug , which means malware or miscreants could use it install malware just by coaxing ie users to browse a hacked or malicious web_site . <end> <start> the fix_it solution is available from this link . <end> <start> to apply it , click the fix it icon above the fix this problem link . <end> <start> applying this solution may limit some functionalities of ie , so if you run into problems after applying this interim patch , you can click the fix it icon to the right of that “ enable ” button to reverse the update . <end> <start> update : as several readers have already noted in the comments , this fix it solution is for 32 - bit versions of ie only . <end> <start> in 64 - bit windows , you can tell whether the browser you ’ re using is a 32 - bit or 64 - bit version by opening the windows task manager ( ctrl+shift+esc ) and clicking the processes tab . <end> <start> the number that appears after the process name ( in this case , iexplore . exe ) indicates the version in use . <end>
<start> microsoft issues patch to fix ie <end> <start> microsoft has issued a security patch to fix a critical vulnerability in its internet_explorer browser which it said has attacked over 2m windows users . <end> <start> the flaw is believed to have already infected as many as 10,000 websites . <end> <start> the `` zero day '' exploit let criminals take over victims ' computers by steering them to infected websites . <end> <start> microsoft 's christopher budd said the software giant `` encourages all ie customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible '' . <end> <start> he also said the threat led microsoft to mobilise security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure `` in the unprecedented time of eight days '' . <end> <start> the company 's security response team said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half-a-dozen versions of ie in around 50 languages . <end> <start> `` even with that , the release emergency response process is n't over , '' said security response alliance director mike reavey . <end> <start> `` there is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . '' <end> <start> microsoft stressed that the flaw was proven to exist only in ie 7 on all applicable versions of windows , but that ie 6 and the `` beta '' release of ie 8 were `` potentially vulnerable '' . <end> <start> users who have automatic updates turned on will receive the patch over the next 24 hours while others can access it via a download . <end> <start> the azn trojan has been making the rounds since the beginning of december but became public knowledge in the last week . <end> <start> unlike other exploits , users only have to visit a malicious site with trojans or other malware in order to become contaminated . <end> <start> once an infected web page is opened , malicious downloaders are installed on the computer designed to record keystrokes and steal passwords , credit card details and other financial information . <end> <start> the sites affected are mostly chinese and have been serving up programmes to steal passwords for computer games which can then be sold for cash on the black market . <end> <start> internet explorer is the world 's most widely used web browser with nearly three quarters of the market share . <end> <start> microsoft estimated that one in every 500 windows users had been exposed to sites that tried to exploit the flaw and the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 % daily . <end> <start> researchers at the software security firm trend micro said attacks were spreading `` like wildfire '' . <end> <start> `` this vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day , '' said the company 's advanced threat researcher paul ferguson . <end> <start> microsoft labelled the bug as `` critical , '' the most serious threat ranking in its four-step scoring programme . <end> <start> the update is something of an unusual move for microsoft and underscores the seriousness of the zero day flaw . <end> <start> the company rarely issues security fixes for its software outside of its regular monthly patch updates . <end> <start> meanwhile mozilla has released a scheduled update for its open source firefox web browsers for at least 10 different vulnerabilities . <end> <start> the bugs in the browser could have been `` used to run attacker code and install software , requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing , '' said mozilla . <end> <start> it is also reissuing calls for users to upgrade from firefox 2.0 to firefox 3.0 as soon as possible and said it is `` not planning any further security and stability updates for firefox 2 '' . <end> <start> this means mozilla will no longer support the firefox 2 browser against future online scams and attacks . <end>
<start> microsoft to release patch for internet_explorer <end> <start> 'the_fix' will remedy a vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain remote control of a windows machine . . <end> <start> wed_,_sep_19_2012_at_11_:_47_am <end> <start> microsoft will push_out an out_-_of_-_cycle windows patch to temporarily fix the critical internet_explorer flaw revealed earlier_this_week . <end> <start> "while we have only seen a few attempts to exploit the issue , impacting an extremely limited number of people , we are taking_this_proactive_step to help ensure internet_explorer customers are protected and able to safely browse online , " microsoft trustworthy computing director yunsun_wee said in a blog_posting on_sept_._18 . <end> <start> "the fix_it is an easy - to - use , one - click , full - strength solution any internet_explorer user can install , " wee wrote . <end> <start> "it will not affect your ability to browse the web , and it will provide full protection against this issue until an update is available . <end> <start> it won ’ t require a reboot of your computer . <end> <start> "this fix_it will be available for everyone to download and install within_the_next_few_days , " she added . <end> <start> microsoft usually pushes_out software updates and security patches on_the_second_tuesday_of_every_month . <end> <start> out - of - cycle patches are reserved for the most serious flaws . <end> <start> it's not clear what exactly microsoft has in mind , if , as wee indicates , the "fix_it" is not a real update . <end> <start> microsoft initially suggested that all internet_explorer users install and configure a utility called the enhanced mitigation experience toolkit ( emet ) to prevent exploitation of the flaw , but admitted emet might interfere with other applications . <end> <start> most security_experts , and the german_government , have recommended a simpler solution : stop using internet explorer entirely until the flaw is fully fixed . <end> <start> the internet explorer vulnerability allows an attacker to gain remote control of a windows machine at the same level of privilege as the current user . <end> <start> that's not so bad if a given machine's current user has limited privileges , but very serious if the current user has administrator rights and can install , modify or delete software . <end> <start> the flaw affects all currently distributed and supported versions of internet explorer and windows : internet explorer versions 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 and windows xp , vista and 7 , as well as windows server 2003 , and 2008 . <end> <start> windows 8 , due to be released to the general public oct . 26 , and its accompanying web browser , internet explorer 10 , are not affected . <end> <start> nor is windows server 2012 . <end>
<start> microsoft issues emergency ie patch as attacks escalate <end> <start> microsoft has issued a rare emergency update for its internet_explorer browser as miscreants stepped_up attacks targeting a vulnerability on hundreds of thousands of webpages . <end> <start> in many cases , the websites distributing the toxic payload are legitimate destinations that have been commandeered , allowing an attacker to snare victims as they surf to online banks , forums , and other trusted sites . <end> <start> there are at least six distinct versions of attack code circulating in the wild , according to researchers at idefense , a security lab owned by verisign . <end> <start> a web search showed 233,000 pages containing the string ardoshanghai.com/s.js , just one of many web addresses exploiting a weakness in the way ie 's data-binding function works . <end> <start> most of the attacks silently install keylogging software as soon as a victim surfs to a site carrying the exploit . <end> <start> once installed , the software steals login credentials for online games . <end> <start> attack strings in separate sql injections include 17gamo.com/1.js . <end> <start> researchers say the number of attack sites is too high to keep exhaustive lists , but shadowserver is doing an admirable job here . <end> <start> `` the vulnerability is so juicy that we expect it to show up in tool kits fairly shortly , '' said rick howard , intelligence director of idefense . <end> <start> the patch was released eight days after reports began circulating that websites were targeting a vulnerability in fully patched versions of ie . <end> <start> this is only the second time in 18 months that microsoft has issued an unscheduled update . <end> <start> typically , patches are available on the second tuesday of each month to allow system administrators time for planning . <end> <start> given the prevalence of attacks , there 's no good reason why anyone running a windows machine should n't stop what they 're doing and install the patch immediately ( those with administrative rights , anyway ) - doing so is as easy as opening ie and selecting windows update from the tools menu . <end> <start> the patch can also be downloaded directly here . <end> <start> howard mentioned the site of `` a major financial institution '' that he found hosting the exploit , so do n't think you 're immune just because you steer clear of porn and warez . <end>
<start> microsoft rushes_out security patch for internet_explorer <end> <start> 17_september_2013_-_21_:_29 <end> <start> normally , microsoft releases security bulletins for software products on the second_tuesday_of_each_month . <end> <start> that happened last_week as scheduled , but today the company announced it has rushed_out an additional patch designed to fix an exploit that has been found in internet_explorer , and is being used in attacks on ie8 and ie9 . <end> <start> in a post on its security response blog , microsoft says the issue would allow a hacker to launch a remote code_execution if a person surfs to a website using ie that contains malicious_code . <end> <start> the blog adds , "there are only reports of a limited number of targeted attacks specifically directed at internet_explorer 8 and 9 , although the issue could potentially affect all supported versions . " <end> <start> the company has released a "fix_-_it"_patch , "cve - 2013 - 3893 mshtml shim workaround" to plug this security hole in all currently supported versions of ie . <end> <start> in addition , microsoft recommends that users set their security_settings on the web_browser to "high" to block any activex_controls and active_scripting on websites . <end> <start> it also recommends users set up ie so that it informs them ahead of time before running any active_scripting features . <end> <start> the company plans to release a full security patch that will be a more complete solution to this problem in_the_near_future . <end>

'' <end> <start> microsoft said the update is for ie on all currently supported versions of windows . <end> <start> users can now download it for their home computers or laptops from microsoft update website . <end> <start> microsoft security experts estimated earlier that roughly 0.2 percent of ie users worldwide may have been exposed to websites containing exploits of the latest vulnerability , which means millions of users are in danger of having their computers infected . <end> <start> latest statistics from research firm net applications showed that ie still dominates the browser market with a share of nearly 70 percent . <end>
<start> microsoft rushes urgent fix for internet_explorer <end> <start> it ’ s not patch_tuesday , but microsoft has released a crucial update for internet_explorer that you should apply immediately . <end> <start> microsoft included a cumulative update for internet_explorer in the 13 security bulletins that made up patch_tuesday_last_week , and that update was considered critical as well . <end> <start> since then , though , a new flaw has been targeted by attacks in_the_wild , so microsoft has responded with an out_-_of_-_band update . <end> <start> apply the urgent fix_-_it solution from microsoft to protect internet_explorer from exploits . <end> <start> the update from microsoft is a fix_-_it tool , which is more of a stop_-_gap bandage than an actual patch . <end> <start> applying the fix_-_it will protect internet_explorer and prevent the currently circulating exploit from working_on your systems . <end> <start> paul_henry , security and forensic analyst with lumension , says that there are number of mitigating factors that limit the potential scope of this threat , but those factors may offer little consolation for many users . <end> <start> “ the bad news is that this is a very wide_-_reaching patch , affecting all versions of ie across all operating systems , from xp to rt , " he says . <end> <start> "and more bad news : the average user is very susceptible to being hit with this . ” <end> <start> microsoft claims that running internet_explorer in enhanced security configuration mode prevents this attack . <end> <start> internet_explorer runs in this restricted mode by default on windows server 2008 , windows server 2008 r2 , windows server 2012 , and windows server 2012 r2 . <end> <start> microsoft states that all supported versions of outlook , outlook express , and windows mail include protection by default as well . <end> <start> html email messages are opened by default in the restricted sites security zone , which disables scripts and activex controls necessary for the exploit to execute . <end> <start> however , microsoft cautions that the protection in outlook only applies to the html message within outlook itself . <end> <start> if a user receives an email with a link and clicks on it , they ’ re still potentially vulnerable because the threat is now web - based and functioning outside of outlook . <end> <start> “ the average user does not run the restricted sites mode , are not using the enhanced security configuration and are all - too - willing to click on phishing emails , " henry explains , "i recommend employing the mitigating factors , as well as advising users about this so they will be less likely to click malicious links until you can apply the patch . <end> <start> it ’ s been a while since we ’ ve seen an out - of - band patch for ie from microsoft , but it ’ s still important to apply it as soon as possible . ” <end> <start> “ it's important to reiterate that all versions of ie are affected including the internet explorer 11 preview , tyler_reguly , technical manager of security research and development for tripwire , says . <end> <start> "since attacks are occurring now , this is a situation where it's in everyone's best interest for microsoft to release a patch as soon as possible . <end> <start> in the meantime , install the shim that they've released . ” <end> <start> he adds , “ for less technical users that aren't comfortable with microsoft fix it solutions , using another browser until a patch is available is the best option , ” <end> <start> a couple additional notes : the fix - it solution only works with 32 - bit versions of internet explorer , and you must first apply the cumulative update for internet explorer from last week ’ s patch tuesday ( ms13 - 069 ) . <end>

5 and they locked_up a playoff spot just one_season_after posting the worst record in the nfl in_2011 – a chiefs - like 2_-_14_mark . <end> <start> meanwhile , the chiefs lost their 13th game of the season and could tie the franchise mark of 14 losses next week in denver against peyton manning and the broncos . <end> <start> the 2008_chiefs ended the season with a 2_-_14_record . <end> <start> on the only positive note for the game , the chiefs had two players rush for over 100 yards apiece –something that hasn ’ t happened to the franchise since 1991 . <end> <start> jamaal charles ( 226 yards ) and peyton hillis ( 101 yards ) led a powerful attack that , for any team other than the 2012 chiefs , would have nearly guaranteed a victory . <end> <start> kc ended the game with 352 net yards rushing . <end> <start> the 1961 dallas texans rushed for 398 yards against houston ( 10 / 1 / 61 ) and the ’ 66 squad gained 380 yards rushing against denver ( 10 / 23 / 66 ) . <end> <start> but this year ’ s team was undone again by three turnovers , a missed field goal , and untimely penalties that wiped out scoring drives . <end> <start> brady_quinn threw two_interceptions , both_of_which had a devastating effect on the chiefs . <end> <start> the first occurred on kansas city ’ s opening drive when quinn threw behind receiver dexter mccluster and colts cornerback , darius butler , picked it off and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown , putting indy up 7 - 0 . <end> <start> quinn ’ s second interception of the game came at a crucial point in the 4th quarter with the team trailing 13 - 10 and with the ball at the indy 14 - yard line . <end> <start> quinn underthrew a pass in the end zone to receiver jon baldwin and was picked off by vontae davis for an indianapolis touchback . <end> <start> yet another potential scoring opportunity blown for the chiefs . <end> <start> quinn threw a third interception – and his second to davis in consecutive series – but it was overturned when davis was called for pass interference . <end> <start> any honest chiefs fan would say that it was the most “ phantom ” interference penalty ever as davis never appeared to touch kc receiver jamar newsome . <end> <start> kicker ryan succop showed his jekyll / hyde nature in the first quarter by nailing a 47 - yard field goal that looked good the moment he kicked it , but then missing a 43 - yarder that would have made the score 7 - 6 . <end> <start> towards the end of the first half , charles made his only mistake of the day by fumbling at the indianapolis 16 - yard line , snuffing out another scoring opportunity with the chiefs behind 10 - 3 . <end> <start> the colts turned the fumble into another field goal and went into halftime leading kc , 13 - 3 . <end> <start> as the second half opened , the chiefs looked like they were going to go into self - destruct mode again when return man , devon wylie , inexplicably tried to return the second - half kickoff from deep in his own end zone and was swarmed under at the 14 - yard line by indy . <end> <start> the few chiefs fans remaining in the stands undoubtedly thought about going home early and getting a head start on dinner . <end> <start> ( personal note : somebody on the special teams ’ coaching staff needs to put leg chains on wylie , who apparently thinks he is former all - pro return man , dante hall . <end> <start> wylie brings out every kick and more often than not , doesn ’ t get the ball back to the 20 - yard line . ) <end> <start> but , showing why he is the best player on the team , charles took a handoff around the left end and with some terrific downfield blocking by baldwin , romped 86 yards for the chiefs first touchdown in nine quarters of football – ironically since charles ’ 80 - yard td run on the opening play of the cleveland game two weeks ago . <end> <start> colts – 13 , chiefs – 10 and a new ballgame . <end> <start> both defenses tightened up in the second half , but the key play of the game came with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 13 - 13 . <end> <start> the chiefs faced a 4th - and - inches at the indy 27 - yd line , but despite having hillis and charles in the backfield , coaches romeo crennel and offensive coordinator brian daboll decided to have quinn try a quarterback sneak . <end> <start> quinn was stopped short and the colts took the ball over on downs . <end> <start> it was here that chiefs fans could see what might have been had they had this awful season last year when colts qb andrew luck was the top prize of the draft . <end> <start> luck had struggled all_day_long under_pressure from the chiefs_defense and the rookie looked very ordinary . <end> <start> however , when it counted , he looked like joe montana . <end> <start> luck calmly led the colts on a 13_-_play_drive that culminated in a laser - like td_throw to reggie_wayne that put the colts up 20 - 13 . <end> <start> i say that chiefs fans could only dream of having luck because if there was ever an indictment of the chiefs qb situation , it came on the next series of downs . <end> <start> with four minutes left in the game , wylie again brought the kick - off out of the end zone and was tackled at the 10 - yard line . <end> <start> ( seriously … somebody cut him now . ) <end> <start> with 90 yards to go and two time outs ( plus the two - minute warning ) in their pocket the chiefs put a big red ribbon on this turd of a season for fans by running the following “ game - winning ” plays : <end> <start> 1st - and - 10 – quinn pass incomplete short right to steve maneri <end> <start> 2nd - and - 10 – jamaal charles up middle for 2 yards <end> <start> 3rd - and - 8 – ( shotgun formation ) peyton hillis around right end for - 2 yards <end> <start> 4th - and - 10 – dustin colquitt punt <end> <start> so on a day when at least nine nfl quarterbacks threw for 300 yards or more ( and three threw for 400+ ) , the chiefs wouldn ’ t let their #1 quarterback attempt to win a game with his arm . <end> <start> one could only assume it ’ s because the odds of jamaal charles ripping off another 90 - yard run was more likely than any of the stiffs playing qb for the chiefs leading a game - winning drive . <end> <start> then , like the grinch that really wanted to screw the fans' holidays , the defense couldn ’ t stop the colts offense as indy easily picked up a first down and ran out the clock . <end> <start> luckily for kc fans , the final indignities of the season will end next week when the free agent qb that infamously spurned the chiefs , peyton manning , leads his 12 - 3 broncos against kc in what may be romeo crennel and scott pioli ’ s last games with the chiefs . <end> <start> manning and the broncos have a legitimate shot at getting the #1 seed in the afc for the playoffs , so they won't be resting anyone for the last game . <end> <start> well , at least not until denver is up by four touchdowns , which may be halftime . <end>

breaking cam newton's record set a year ago . <end> <start> dwayne allen also set a colts rookie record for receptions by a tight end with 43 . <end> <start> allen has had a tremendous rookie year . <end> <start> he has a bright future ahead of him . <end> <start> cassius vaughn and pat angerer both were terrible today . <end> <start> there were others as well , but those two were the ones that really stuck out . <end> <start> basically , however , the whole defense stunk today . <end> <start> the colts gave up 507 total yards , 352 of them on the ground . <end> <start> it was the worst run defense i have seen the colts play since that now infamous debacle in jacksonville in 2006 . <end> <start> simply must improve . <end> <start> that said , the colts won the turnover battle 3 - 0 over the chiefs . <end> <start> darius butler picked off a terrible brady quinn throw and took it back 32 yards for a score . <end> <start> it was butler's 4th pick of the year and the 2nd one he returned for a touchdown . <end> <start> pat angerer also forced a big fumble with the chiefs in the red zone and threatening that led to 3 points for the colts before the half . <end> <start> and then the 3rd turnover was a pick by vontae davis . <end> <start> when you have a +3 turnover differential , you are going to win most games . <end> <start> it will be huge if the colts could keep that up . <end> <start> the wide receivers really didn't help out andrew luck today . <end> <start> they dropped several passes ( reggie wayne included ) and failed to get open numerous other times . <end> <start> while it looked like a bad game from luck , i place more of the blame on the receivers in this one . <end> <start> nothing was open . <end> <start> however , on the final drive , once reggie wayne started getting involved , the colts started rolling . <end> <start> on the last drive he caught 3 passes for 37 yards and a touchdown . <end> <start> prior to that he had caught 2 passes for 44 . <end> <start> the key was that once the colts got reggie involved , good things happened . <end> <start> this game was andrew luck's 7th game - winning drive of the season , tying an nfl record - not just a rookie record . <end> <start> peyton manning did it twice . <end> <start> incredibly , if luck leads a game winning drive next week in a very winnable game for the colts , he would have the nfl record all to himself - as a rookie . <end> <start> added to that fact is that the colts are 8 - 1 in games decided by one score or less - the only loss coming in week 3 on that last - minute 80 yard touchdown pass by the jaguars after luck had led another go - ahead scoring drive late in the 4th quarter . <end> <start> chuck pagano returns tomorrow . <end> <start> what a moment that will be tomorrow when pagano walks into the locker room and is handed the head coaching reigns once again . <end> <start> and what a moment that will be next sunday when he takes the field for the first time since week 3 . <end> <start> colts nation has supported him all the way , as has the nfl . <end> <start> next sunday , the division rival houston texans come to lucas oil stadium having never won in indy . <end> <start> this is a game that before the season i even thought the colts would win - back when i thought they would get 7 wins all year . <end> <start> they can beat the texans , and with pagano coming back , that will be a special game . <end> <start> great job , bruce arians . <end> <start> tremendous . <end> <start> now my piece of advice to the colts -

<start> after more than three_years and a tangled trail of frustrating legal delays , the man who killed four people in a brazen courthouse escape was sentenced saturday to prison for life_without_parole and hundreds_of_years more . <end> <start> yet prosecutors who spent the last month urging jurors to sentence one of atlanta 's most notorious criminals to death were not celebrating . <end> <start> `` the community has spoken , '' fulton county district attorney paul howard said at an emotional press conference after the sentencing of brian nichols . <end> <start> `` even though we are puzzled and terribly disappointed by the decision , we must accept the conclusion provided by our community .

<start> fulton courthouse killer brian_nichols was sentenced saturday_morning to seven life sentences and four sentences of life without parole plus 485_years for the crimes he committed on march_11_,_2005 , that stunned metro_atlanta and the_nation . <end> <start> brian nichols was saved from a death sentence by three jurors who were determined that he instead spend his life in prison , no matter how many people he killed . <end> <start> fulton county district attorney paul howard suggested saturday that the possibility of a death penalty was doomed - even before jury selection - by the three holdouts . <end> <start> `` i talked to two jurors and they both say that some people showed up for jury duty with their minds already made up and never entered into a meaningful discussion of a death sentence , '' howard said saturday after nichols was sentenced . <end> <start> `` that means we did n't get a fair trial . '' <end> <start> the two jurors , who indicated they were among the nine voting to put nichols to death , reported one of the holdouts even worked a crossword puzzle while the panel deliberated nichols ' fate for 40 hours over four days . <end> <start> the frustrated prosecutor gambled on getting a death penalty decision when he denied a nichols offer a year ago to plead guilty in exchange for a life prison sentence . <end> <start> he said saturday that he would urge georgia lawmakers to amend the law - that now requires a unanimous decision - to allow a 10-juror majority approve a death penalty . <end> <start> `` we 're not asking for favors - we are just asking for a level playing field , '' howard said . <end> <start> `` people who will not deliberate should not be permitted to continue to serve on juries . '' <end> <start> he was especially vexed because the holdouts were evidently not truthful when questioned by lawyers about whether they could impose the death penalty before they were chosen for the jury . <end> <start> he said all the jurors swore under oath that they could consider death for nichols if they felt the crimes deserved it . <end> <start> inside the jury room , however , the three holdouts told the other nine jurors that they would not impose death for any killings . <end> <start> in fact , howard said , the nine pro-death jurors asked the three holdouts how many people would nichols have to kill before they would be willing to vote for execution . <end> <start> `` they asked , 'how about if it had been 50 people ? ' '' howard said . <end> <start> `` and the three people said it would n't make any difference at all . '' <end> <start> the two female jurors , one white and one black , spoke publicly at a news conference saturday to express their exasperation <end> <start> `` i want the families to know we did everything we could do , `` said the white woman , who was identified as juror no. 12 . <end> <start> family members of the four murder victims expressed outrage that nichols had escaped the death penalty . <end> <start> `` i feel in some ways he is proud of what he did , '' said deborah teasley , widow of a sheriff 's deputy nichols murdered . <end> <start> `` he was constantly sitting there at the defense table with a smirk on his face . '' <end> <start> the two jurors , who did not give their names , said the closed-door jury deliberations never became hostile during the four days they tried to decide a penalty . <end> <start> `` everyone was respectful , `` said juror no. 8 , one of six african-american women on the panel . <end> <start> `` we were able to state our opinions . <end> <start> but we would not back down . '' <end> <start> it was the pro-death majority , hoping to sway the three holdouts , who sought the replay of the bombshell jailhouse tape recording of nichols talking with his brother on a telephone call . <end> <start> `` we were searching , '' juror no. 12 said . <end> <start> an angry nichols was recorded saying he did n't regret the four murders and would have taken his rampage to the da 's office in the courthouse if given the chance again . <end> <start> defense attorneys vehemently objected to the tape as `` highly prejudicial , '' though judge james bodiford said jurors could rehear just the portion played for them at trial . <end> <start> in the end , the jury did not follow through with a formal written request for the tape . <end> <start> the two jurors kept their public comments limited at the news conference . <end> <start> other jurors contacted by the atlanta journal-constitution , including the jury foreman , declined to talk or answer questions left for them at their residences . <end> <start> the jury - six black women , two white women , two black men , one white man and one asian man - began hearing the case sept. 22 and convicted nichols on nov. 7 after 12 hours of deliberation . <end> <start> the trial then entered a four-week penalty phase , with prosecution witnesses testifying that nichols is still a remorseless killer plotting constantly to escape , and defense witnesses testifying he had a troubled childhood and has shown signs of remorse and redemption . <end> <start> howard said the jurors in the majority told him after reporting their 9-3 deadlock to bodiford that they did not know they could have asked bodiford to replace with alternates the three who refused to deliberate with them . <end> <start> on friday morning , a day after the 9-3 deadlock was first reported , prosecutor kellie hill asked bodiford to ask the jury if all of the jurors were participating in good faith . <end> <start> defense lawyers objected , arguing to bodiford that any such inquiry during the penalty phase would amount to coercion - which could result in a reversal on appeal . <end> <start> josh moore , one of the defense lawyers , had reminded the judge earlier that unanimity in the penalty phase was not required . <end> <start> `` georgia law shows no preference for a unanimous verdict in the sentencing phase of a death case , '' he said . <end> <start> howard said state law is murky on whether a judge could inquire or replace jurors during the penalty phase . <end> <start> the law also permits each juror to follow his or her personal morality on determining whether to impose a death sentence , as long as the juror can honestly consider it . <end> <start> howard said he hoped the legislature also would change the law , which permits vague responses during jury selection on whether potential jurors would be willing to impose the death penalty . <end> <start> victims ' relatives said any nichols victory was hollow . <end> <start> `` i do n't think brian nichols won , '' said christina greenway , daughter of the court reporter nichols murdered . <end> <start> `` in his own words , it is not in his dna to stay in prison . <end> <start> now he can look forward to a life in prison .

<start> internet and telephone traffic between_europe_and_the_middle_east_and_asia was hampered friday after three major underwater data_lines were cut , according to france_telecom . <end> <start> the cut occurred on lines between_07:28_and_08:06_coordinated_universal_time_(_utc ) on lines in_the_mediterranean_sea that connect sicily to_tunisia_and_egypt , the telecommunications_company said . <end> <start> the cuts were to the sea_me_we_4 and sea_me_we_3 lines , which connect countries_between_singapore_and_france as well as the flag_cable_route , which stretches from_the_u.k. to_japan , a france_telecom spokeswoman who asked not to be named said . <end> <start> france_telecom is n't sure what caused the cut , she said . <end> <start> france telecom is n't sure what caused the cut , she said . <end> <start> `` we have two assumptions . <end> <start> the first is that it could be an underwater earthquake , '' she said . <end> <start> `` or it could be simply a ship in the area which has cut the cable .

'' <end> <start> a large number of these came back on-line around 17:00 utc , mcpherson said . <end> <start> most likely this happened after isps ( internet service providers ) that had been knocked off-line had found alternate routes for their traffic . <end> <start> it 's hard to estimate how many internet users were affected by the cut , but the internet has a total of close to 300,000 such routes , he said . <end> <start> this is not the first time this year that these cables have been cut . <end> <start> earlier this year both the sea me we 4 and flag cables were cut . <end> <start> flag 's cable was reportedly cut by ships anchored off the coast of alexandria , egypt . <end>

<start> hansbrough sets carolina 's career scoring record <end> <start> reigning national player of the year tyler_hansbrough has broken the career scoring_record at north_carolina . <end> <start> the 6-foot-9 senior needed nine points in the top-ranked tar heels ' game against evansville on thursday night to pass phil ford for the record . <end> <start> he tied ford on a jumper from_the_left_wing with_14:05_left , then set the mark by banking_in a turnaround shot with_7:41_left in the first_half . <end> <start> after the record-setting point , officials briefly stopped the game to allow ford , coach roy williams and athletics director dick baddour to present hansbrough with the game ball . <end> <start> ford finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points . <end>
<start> mcdermott fuels bluejays in valley_tournament win <end> <start> doug_mcdermott got a scoring_record friday , will_artino got a chance to showcase his skills on_the_big_stage and gregory_echenique got mad . <end> <start> the first_two factored heavily into creighton ’ s 65_-_53 victory against drake in the quarterfinals of the missouri_valley_conference_tournament , but the last_one might have been the deciding factor in moving the bluejays along to saturday ’ s semifinals . <end> <start> echenique scored all 11_points of his points in_the_second_half , grabbed 11_rebounds and blocked six_shots . <end> <start> six of his points , five of his rebounds and five of the blocks came after echenique got roughed up — tackled , he said — while cutting toward the basket midway through the second half . <end> <start> no foul was called , but drake might have wished one had been . <end> <start> after the no - call , the 6 - foot - 9 , 260 - pound echenique turned up the intensity to fuel a 15 - 2 run that turned a 47 - 44 creighton lead into a 16 - point cushion . <end> <start> “ it made me kind of mad when that happened , ” echenique said . <end> <start> “ it changed my attitude a little , and gave me a little more of an edge . <end> <start> i had to find a way to get that anger out , and i couldn ’ t say anything to the ref and risk getting a technical or something . <end> <start> “ i think i did the right thing , and it kind of capped my focus . <end> <start> it made me play harder . ” <end> <start> with echenique leading the late charge , creighton finally subdued a stubborn bulldog team that was playing to extend its season in an atmosphere that resembled a bluejays home game . <end> <start> creighton fans filled almost two - thirds of the 9 , 000 seats in the lower bowl of the scottrade center , and experienced some anxious moments before their team finally took command . <end> <start> mcdermott , artino and echenique figured heavily into the outcome that improved the bluejays to 25_-_7 and advanced them to a 1_:_35_p_._m . semifinal_meeting against indiana state , which defeated evansville 51_-_50 in friday ’ s second_quarterfinal . <end> <start> “ will was great the first half and made some great plays in the second half , ” creighton coach greg mcdermott said . <end> <start> “ doug was consistent offensively throughout , and i thought gregory really changed the game defensively in the second half . <end> <start> “ there was nothing that happened in the paint because of his energy and his ability to block some shots and change shots . <end> <start> and he went and got the basketball off the boards . ” <end> <start> doug_mcdermott finished with 23_points , setting the school scoring_record when he got his 11th_point on a free_throw with_4_:_43_left_in_the_first_half . <end> <start> he made 8 of 14 shots from the field , including 3 of 4 3 - pointers , and grabbed seven rebounds . <end> <start> artino , whose role has grown as his productivity has increased during the second half of the season , had a career - high 14 points and six rebounds . <end> <start> five of his points came in a 7 - 0 run in the first half that turned a 12 - 12 tie into a lead creighton never relinquished . <end> <start> still , things were getting tight when drake , which had defeated bradley in thursday ’ s play - in round , closed to 47 - 44 on seth vandeest ’ s basket with 10 : 03 to play . <end> <start> on their next possession , the 15 - 17 bulldogs missed an open 3 - pointer that would have tied the game . <end> <start> in between , echenique found himself sprawled on the court after getting bumped hard as he moved toward the basket on a pick - and - roll play . <end> <start> he stayed down for several seconds , then glared at a referee as he got to his feet . <end> <start> echenique turned into an aggressive force in the final 10 minutes . <end> <start> “ we are a totally different team , ” greg mcdermott said when asked what a fired - up echenique means to his club . <end> <start> “ we don ’ t resemble the team that we are when he isn ’ t playing like that . <end> <start> he is so active . <end> <start> he made multiple plays on several possessions . <end> <start> “ i ’ m really proud of him , because sometimes it ’ s hard to get the switch flipped . <end> <start> when it gets flipped , he ’ s hard to deal with . ” <end> <start> echenique ’ s dunk and free throw after being fouled started creighton ’ s decisive run , putting the bluejays ahead 50 - 44 . <end> <start> a vandeest layup would cut the bulldogs ’ deficit to four , but they wouldn ’ t score again for almost eight minutes while creighton stretched its lead to 62 - 46 . <end> <start> “ you have to know how to use it when you get mad , ” echenique said . <end> <start> “ i think i used it the right way out there today . ” <end> <start> his teammates know the bluejays are a different team when echenique is engaged , one reason doug mcdermott pulled him aside at halftime . <end> <start> echenique had missed both of his shots in the first 20 minutes and , mcdermott said , appeared to be down on himself . <end> <start> “ i just told him , ‘ greg , you have to be the man here , ’   ” doug said . <end> <start> “ i told him he was going to be our guy and we were going to feed him the ball . <end> <start> he took that to heart and played with a command . <end> <start> “ i ’ m proud of him , and hopefully he can continue to bring that night after night . ” <end> <start> echenique scored five of creighton ’ s first eight points in the second half . <end> <start> artino then had four in row as creighton opened its first 10 - point lead of the game before drake countered with a 9 - 2 spurt that got the bulldogs back with three points . <end> <start> echenique “ was definitely a big factor , ” said vandeest , who had 13 points . <end> <start> “ he has a huge body and uses his body around the basket . <end> <start> he really stepped up in the second half . ” <end> <start> drake coach mark phelps agreed . <end> <start> “ look at his numbers , ” phelps said . <end> <start> “ he had 11 and 11 , and had six blocks . <end> <start> he was really good tonight . ” <end> <start> artino was never better . <end> <start> his 14 points bettered his career high of 13 . <end> <start> he was two rebounds off his personal best , and his play , especially in the first half , gave creighton a huge boost . <end> <start> “ will was tremendous , ” doug mcdermott said . <end> <start> “ he ’ s so easy to play with because he can see over the defense , he ’ s good at the high - low pass and he crashes the boards every time . <end> <start> it ’ s great to have a guy like will on the team . ” <end> <start> it goes without saying that it ’ s pretty valuable to have mcdermott around , too . <end> <start> he came in needing 11_points to break rodney_buford ’ s scoring_record of 2_,_106 . <end> <start> mcdermott had 10 points in the first 7 ½ minutes , then broke the record when he made the first of two free throws with 4 : 43 left in the half . <end> <start> mcdermott now has 2_,_029_points in 106_games as a bluejay , but who ’ s counting ? <end> <start> “ it ’ s a special feeling that i can ’ t explain to pass guys like kyle korver , guys i looked up to in my childhood , ” he said . <end> <start> “ and to do it in front of a big crowd here in st . louis is cool . <end> <start> “ but i don ’ t even think about that stuff . <end> <start> you guys are going to make the most of it , but i ’ m just out there trying to win and play hard every night . ” <end>

<start> hansbrough breaks unc scoring record <end> <start> the tar heels and the purple aces play a game , but the attention is on record-setting unc senior tyler hansbrough . <end> <start> since the day he stepped foot on north carolina 's campus , forward tyler hansbrough has been working to diversify his offensive resume by trying to extend his shooting range . <end> <start> but it seemed appropriate that when it came time to break unc 's three-decades-old career scoring record during the top-ranked tar heels ' 91-73 basketball victory over evansville on thursday night , the senior went back to an old staple : a workmanlike power move . <end> <start> with 7:42 left in the first half at the smith center , hansbrough muscled around purple aces forwards james haarsma and pieter van tongeren to bank in a shot off the glass and score his 10th point of the game and 2,292nd point of his career . <end> <start> that basket broke the mark of 2,290 that point guard phil_ford set from_1974 to_1978 . <end> <start> hansbrough finished with 20 points and now has 2,302 for his career . <end> <start> `` it was very fitting -- three guys on him , he was moving to the basket , kind of off-balance , he banks it in with his soft hands , '' said gene hansbrough , who surprised his son by attending the game . <end> <start> `` it was a perfect shot for tyler to break the record on . '' <end> <start> point guard ty lawson also chipped in 16 points for the tar heels ( 10-0 ) , though coach roy williams looked frustrated at times by his team 's performance , particularly after evansville 's shy ely ended the first half with a dunk . <end> <start> that led the coach to stomp off the court despite the fact that his team led by 18 points . <end> <start> the night , however , belonged to hansbrough , who accepted the game ball and an embrace from ford , now an assistant coach for the nba 's charlotte bobcats , immediately after setting the record . <end> <start> after the game , ford pressed his hands together and bowed to the big man at mid-court , congratulating him as fans in the sellout crowd -- some of whom held signs reading `` phil ford 2,290 '' on one side and `` tyler 2,291 + '' on the other -- were on their feet for a rousing ovation . <end> <start> `` it 's an honor to be compared in the same breath at tyler , '' ford said later . <end> <start> `` when i see how hard he plays , and how he listens to coach williams -- as a player , that 's why i tried to do . '' <end> <start> then hansbrough -- who followed his record-breaking bucket with a missed dunk attempt that probably will make the team blooper reel -- choked up as he watched a montage of current and former players congratulate him on the accomplishment . <end> <start> `` i got a little emotional , because you may not know all those guys [ in the video ] , but you 've got a connection , because you played here and you 're part of something that i consider a family , '' he said . <end> <start> hansbrough , who also grabbed nine rebounds , had already secured his place in tar heels history -- and in the retired jersey portion of the smith center rafters , near ford -- by earning consensus national player-of-the-year honors last season . <end> <start> breaking such a long-standing record adds to his still-blooming legend . <end> <start> ford passed the likes of lennie rosenbluth , charles scott and larry miller because they could play varsity basketball for only three years . <end> <start> antawn jamison , michael jordan and rashad mccants failed to pass ford because they stayed just three seasons . <end> <start> then came hansbrough , the sometimes awkward-looking big man from poplar bluff , mo. , who opted to forgo going to the nba after his freshman , sophomore and junior seasons in order to try to win an ncaa title . <end> <start> although he said he was a little nervous straying from the lane his rookie season , he actually scored his first tar heels bucket on nov. 19 , 2005 , when he led a three-on-two fast break against gardner-webb that finished with his jump shot in the lane . <end> <start> and he has barely slowed since , topping unc 's chart for all-time free-throw attempts -- he passed the 1,000 mark thursday night -- en route to his latest record . <end> <start> `` i wanted it on a 3 , '' hansbrough said of the record-setting bucket , `` but in a game , i realize you have to do what you have to do . '' <end> <start> which in his case , means playing with power and honing his improving finesse . <end> <start> if he remains healthy , the combination probably will help him become the acc 's all-time leading scorer , as well . <end> <start> former duke star j.j. redick holds that mark with 2,769 points . <end> <start> `` i do n't put anything past tyler . <end> <start> if somebody tells me he 's going to break the nba scoring record -- boy , that 's going to be hard -- but you never say never when it comes to tyler , '' gene hansbrough said . <end> <start> `` he 's got a strong will . '' <end> <start> danny green ( 14 points ) became the 61st player in unc history to score 1,000 points when he buried a 3-pointer in the second half . <end>
<start> the historical record will show that with_7:42_remaining in_the_first_half against evansville 's purple_aces , tyler_hansbrough became unc 's all-time leading scorer , slipping a screen , fighting through a double-team , and banking in a two-pointer for his tenth_point of the game and the 2,292nd_point of his career . <end> <start> the record will show this in no small part because at least 20 sportswriters were diligently typing behind the home basket , writing versions of the same words at the very same moment . <end> <start> if there was going to be any mistake , it was quickly corrected by carolina 's sports information army , abuzz all evening to ensure the moment was preserved perfectly . <end> <start> then there were the photographers , on hand to document each move , each point , each congratulatory handshake . <end> <start> beyond them , more than 20,000 witnesses ran their own internal documentary systems , surely thinking about how they 'll tell future generations of tar heel fans that they were present . <end> <start> some might remember the moment coming at 7:41 , a tick of a second later than the actual basket , when the game clock was stopped for a tastefully brief ceremony and the obligatory photo op . <end> <start> let the record show their memories were wrong , but it wo n't diminish the telling and retelling until history becomes legend , as it usually does . <end> <start> often history happens in quieter places , witnessed by fewer people , not fully appreciated or understood until much later . <end> <start> but this episode was not left for chance . <end> <start> it had been anticipated for months , ever since carolina 's lunch-bucket all-american decided to return for his senior season -- not because he cared a lick about breaking phil ford 's almost 30-year-old record , but because he loves student life on campus , loves basketball , and wanted to keep doing both at the same time as long as possible . <end> <start> the only hitch in the script was a sore shin and a twisted ankle that deferred the night for a few weeks , into late december , an early christmas gift to the faithful who filled ( well , almost filled ) the smith center on a misty night . <end> <start> everything else followed the script nicely . <end> <start> espn dutifully ensured a national audience would share the moment on television . <end> <start> then hansbrough 's father , gene , made his surprise arrival at a game he was n't expected to attend . <end> <start> but how could he miss it , really ? <end> <start> having nurtured his son 's talent and his competitive drive and his character and everything else along the way , history demanded he be in his seat , ready to stand and salute his son as he swallowed down the lump in his throat and expressed his love and thanks . <end> <start> evansville proved the story 's perfect villain , keeping it close through the early stages , and giving an already charged-up crowd opportunity to boo lustily as the purple aces ' physical big men knocked hansbrough to the ground on several occasions . <end> <start> did n't they know that 's how hansbrough would have wanted it -- physically challenged , and therefore determined to crush them into submission ? <end> <start> ford , meanwhile , made a gentlemanly entrance , gracefully shook hands with fans of all ages , posed for pictures , and waited in the wings for history to arrive . <end> <start> after it did , he was pure class , thanking roy williams , hansbrough , and the university for asking him to be a part of the night . <end> <start> `` it 's a dream come true for me , '' he said , sounding genuinely honored to be passing the torch to a player who , like him , gave his best for the program and properly understands that team success , not individual records , are the real measure of success . <end> <start> even with the game underway and subject to unpredictable bounces , an official 's phantom call , or some other twist of fate , the script held . <end> <start> the first points came from the foul line , swishing through the basket without a doubt , as they have more often than for any other carolina player before him . <end> <start> one reminder of greatness in the books . <end> <start> the next points rapidly followed on a series of jumpers , well beyond the range of anything doubters expected the brawling forward to hit on a regular basis when he was a freshman . <end> <start> `` i 'll prove you wrong , '' you could almost hear him thinking as he hit each one , showcasing the senior 's evolution into a complete player . <end> <start> another reminder : players like this come along only once in a generation . <end> <start> then there was the struggle , as teammates worked to get him the ball in scoring position . <end> <start> having told everyone he wanted to break the record on a three , he camped out on the wing for one possession but failed to get a touch . <end> <start> on another , he posted hard inside as danny green took and missed an open three ; <end> <start> as the heels ran to the other end , williams appeared to holler at green for failing to look inside first . <end> <start> on this night , with history looming , even good quality shots needed to wait for the moment . <end> <start> but the struggle was needed , too . <end> <start> has n't that been the essence of carolina 's working-class hero : the battler , scrapping for everything , finding success as much through passion as through athletic ability or skill ? <end> <start> it took will -- and a brief stint on the bench -- before the moment came . <end> <start> then , sure as sure , it did . <end> <start> because it did , a number of things will be quickly forgotten . <end> <start> though tywon lawson had another dominant performance and danny green ( who broke a milestone of his own with his 1,000th career point ) showcased the increasingly confident game that makes his summer draft experiment seem less surprising , the tar heels grinded their way through a game with 16 turnovers -- two more than evansville -- and only 17 assists . <end> <start> deon thompson never established a rhythm , taken out of his finesse game by the purple aces ' physical style . <end> <start> early in the second half , williams yanked out all five starters and replaced them with a blue team , unhappy with the focus and effort . <end> <start> and wayne ellington 's shooting slump continued , his normally perfect stroke disconcertingly slow to return from the finals break . <end> <start> it was another double-digit win , and against a quality mid-major opponent , but a work of art it was n't . <end> <start> hansbrough , who looked as though he was pressing all night despite finishing with another 20-point , 9-rebound performance , admitted to the nerves . <end> <start> they were particularly evident on his next touch after the record-breaking points , when hansbrough stole an inbounds pass , only to brick a dunk attempt off the back of the rim -- another moment that will probably be erased as history gives way to legend . <end> <start> `` i felt like there was a lot of pressure , '' he said . <end> <start> `` i did n't want to strictly focus on the scoring record . <end> <start> we had a game and i was trying to do whatever i could to help the team . <end> <start> now i 'm glad it 's over , and i 'm ready to move on . '' <end> <start> williams agreed . <end> <start> `` i said , `` i 'm glad we got that behind us , now let 's focus on playing better , and let 's focus on guarding somebody . '' <end> <start> i do n't look up at the scoreboard , but it was the first time that i can ever remember counting points in my head . <end> <start> so when [ the shot ] goes in , it was immediately a feeling of elation , and [ then ] a feeling of relief that we got that out of the way . '' <end> <start> danny green acknowledged the team was ready to move on as well . <end> <start> `` yeah , definitely , '' he said . <end> <start> `` the one record we want to break is the winning record , going undefeated for an entire season and hopefully getting a national championship . <end> <start> that 's the record i want to achieve . '' <end> <start> history will remember this night , the emotions of the tribute video that followed the game , and the warmth of the celebratory laughter in the media room . <end> <start> but in the locker room , business remained . <end> <start> and in a brief quote that will probably be lost to memory , phil ford told the real story of the night in words that will echo until winter turns to spring . <end> <start> `` when i was coach here , if we did n't make the final four , it was a bad season , '' he said . <end> <start> `` and now , this guy , '' he continued , looking to hansbrough , '' if he does n't win a national title , he has a bad season . '' <end> <start> hansbrough did n't flinch , but the eyes flashed with recognition . <end> <start> the record is set , but history is still waiting . <end>
<start> hansbrough broke ford 's all-time scoring_record at north_carolina during the game . <end> <start> a captive audience that included an emotional tyler hansbrough watched intently as the smith center video boards mixed in congratulatory remarks with the collection of memorable plays . <end> <start> the accompanying music : o.a.r. hit `` shattered .

one more year ! one more year ! ” <end> <start> indeed . <end> <start> but for all of mcdermott ’ s historic accomplishments and his game - high scoring output , the storyline from the cu side of things was the combined play of gregory echenique and will artino . <end> <start> echenique hadn ’ t scored much in two games against drake earlier this season : he put up just 2 points in a 30 - point cu win in omaha , and then battled foul trouble all night in des moines as drake upset cu . <end> <start> and he went scoreless in the first half friday . <end> <start> but up stepped artino , echenique ’ s sub when the cu coaching staff goes in favor of size and a high / low game instead of ethan wragge ’ s shooting touch from deep . <end> <start> friday afternoon , artino gave the bluejays 14 energized and efficient minutes . <end> <start> entering february , he had played double - digit minutes in just six games . <end> <start> since the calendar flipped from january , though , he ’ s had five such games . <end> <start> friday was arguably his most important performance of the season , given the stakes . <end> <start> artino checked in at the under - 16 : 00 media timeout and immediately broke a 12 - 12 tie with a dunk . <end> <start> fouled on the flush , he finished the traditional three - point play with a free throw . <end> <start> two trips later , artino missed a shot but secured the follow and scored again . <end> <start> he would grab two more rebounds before checking out with 9 : 07 to play in the first half . <end> <start> while he was in , creighton ’ s lead grew as great as 9 points . <end> <start> in 8 first - half minutes , the guy teammates and fans call big swag scored 7 points and ripped down 5 rebounds . <end> <start> he played the high - low possessions well . <end> <start> while drake held echenique scoreless in the first half , artino was able to find success . <end> <start> he finished the day with a career - high 14 points and 6 rebounds ( 5 on the offensive glass ) . <end> <start> in the second half , though , echenique got , um , engaged with things . <end> <start> he scored all 11 of his points , grabbed 6 of his team - high 11 rebounds , and swatted 5 of his season - high 6 blocked shots ( the 6 blocks are second - most in an mvc tournament game ) . <end> <start> during the game ’ s deciding 15 - 2 run , echenique scored two traditional three - point plays , grabbed 3 of his 11 rebounds , and blocked two shots . <end> <start> hammered on a no - call and forced to play at a disadvantage based on inconsistent referring in the frontcourt , echenique seemed fired up . <end> <start> he flexed a few times , too , so as to remind the bulldogs who the alpha dog in the paint was on friday afternoon . <end> <start> the tournament ’ s top seed sticks around for semifinal saturday . <end> <start> the 1998 bradley braves remains the only play - in winner to advance past the quarterfinals , when they beat a two - seeded creighton team . <end> <start> wichita state survived a close game against missouri state friday evening , and illinois state broke away late from northern iowa to advance as the six - seed . <end> <start> the valley will have four solid fan bases represented in the scottrade center saturday afternoon , with white and blue and black and gold the predominant colors swirling around the lower bowl . <end> <start> the day sets up for some solid matchups : <end> <start> the last time the two teams played , indiana state made creighton look completely lost . <end> <start> a blacked out crowd in terre haute helped the sycamores to a resounding win . <end> <start> meanwhile , it took a carmichael karate kick and other late - game miscues for illinois state to practically hand over a win to wichita state in normal . <end>

<start> creighton's doug_mcdermott returns for senior_season <end> <start> doug mcdermott ’ s teammates figured it was just another day in the gym wednesday afternoon . <end> <start> they were playing pick - up games with a guy they didn ’ t know for sure would be around next season . <end> <start> but mcdermott had a secret . <end> <start> shortly before hitting the court , mcdermott had told his father , creighton coach greg mcdermott , that he intended to return for his senior season rather than declare for the nba draft . <end> <start> father and son then informed creighton athletic director bruce rasmussen . <end> <start> doug called his mom to break the news to her , then stepped into the gym to play a little ball . <end> <start> “ he wasn ’ t acting any different , ” grant gibbs said . <end> <start> “ business as usual . ” <end> <start> later that night , mcdermott let the news slip to a couple of them . <end> <start> “ i had to go to class today , knowing that he was going to announce it , and try to be super low - key , ” jahenns manigat said . <end> <start> “ but i couldn ’ t stop smiling . ” <end> <start> it ’ s safe to assume bluejay_nation had much the same reaction when , shortly_before_2_p_._m . , mcdermott sent_out the following message on_twitter : <end> <start> “ i will be returning to creighton for my senior_year and can ’ t wait to put_on that uniform for one_more season . ” <end> <start> mcdermott ’ s return for his senior season will allow a fan base that has come to marvel at his on - court accomplishments the past three seasons one more chance to watch him . <end> <start> college basketball insiders see his return possibly giving creighton more of a fighting chance as it moves into the new big east . <end> <start> for mcdermott , it will give him a chance to make more of an orderly transition from college basketball to professional basketball . <end> <start> he knows he ’ s taking a risk from a financial standpoint . <end> <start> “ that ’ s definitely a lot of money i ’ m passing down , but that money could be there next year , ” mcdermott told reporters thursday . <end> <start> “ it might not be quite as much , but you really can ’ t put a price tag on a senior year . ” <end> <start> that was the same theme that mcdermott touched on repeatedly wednesday night in an exclusive interview with the world - herald . <end> <start> in the final analysis , mcdermott ’ s heart won out over the cash . <end> <start> “ my heart has been telling me all along to stay , but my mind tried to take over a couple of times , ” mcdermott said . <end> <start> “ i just ended up trusting myself that i was making the right decision . ” <end> <start> his mind , of course , focused on the financial benefits that might be his had he decided to turn professional . <end> <start> based on evaluations he received from the nba draft advisory committee , mcdermott said , “ there was no doubt in my mind that i would have been a first - round pick . ” <end> <start> that would have meant a two - year , guaranteed contract that could have been worth between a minimum of $888 , 600 to $1 . 4 million if he had been selected with one of the last 15 picks in the lower half of the first round . <end> <start> that initially had his father recommending that his son turn pro . <end> <start> “ he knew my dream is to play in the nba , and he just felt that this was too good of an opportunity to pass up , ” doug said . <end> <start> “ but the way i look at it , if i can play in the nba , i can play there the next year just as well as i can next year . <end> <start> “ i feel there are things i can work on . <end> <start> i feel i can still improve my draft stock by playing in the big east . <end> <start> there are a lot of areas that i can get better at , and i just felt i ’ d be more comfortable doing it here in omaha . ” <end> <start> mcdermott had heard more than once from outsiders that he should turn pro because he had nothing left to prove as a collegian . <end> <start> the 6 - foot - 8 , 225 - pound forward has been a consensus first - team all - american in each of the past two seasons . <end> <start> he broke creighton ’ s career_scoring_record near the end of the last_season . <end> <start> that argument might have swayed some players , but if there is anything mcdermott has shown the past three seasons it ’ s that he ’ s an unconventional superstar . <end> <start> he remains as unassuming as the day he stepped on campus in june 2010 . <end> <start> he embraces the attention from an adoring fan base that some players might find stifling . <end> <start> it ’ s that fan base , mcdermott said , that figured prominently into his decision . <end> <start> “ i care so much about creighton , ” he said . <end> <start> “ there are a lot of people around here that believed in me . <end> <start> this whole fan base has been with me from the start . <end> <start> i felt like i owed them one more year . ” <end> <start> mcdermott said the opportunity to play in the new conference became more of a factor as he got deeper into the decision - making process . <end> <start> he admitted had creighton remained in the missouri valley it might have made it easier to turn pro . <end> <start> but the opportunity to play in the big east , and perhaps prove a few people wrong , was too much to pass up . <end> <start> “ i feel there are a lot of people that don ’ t believe we can be successful in the big east , ” mcdermott said . <end> <start> “ if you ask anyone on our team , we feel that we ’ re going to be capable of doing some damage there . <end> <start> “ that played into my decision a lot . <end> <start> i care for the guys in this program and i care for the coaches . <end> <start> i wanted to do what i could to help make this transition a successful one . ” <end> <start> what didn ’ t factor into his decision , he said , was the fear that he would be leaving his dad in a tight spot had he bolted for the nba . <end> <start> as greg mcdermott said thursday , his son ’ s 23 points and eight rebounds a game will come in handy next season . <end> <start> but doug said his father and creighton would have been fine had he decided to leave . <end> <start> “ he never pushed for me to stay , ” doug said . <end> <start> in an interview with the world - herald on tuesday , mcdermott indicated he might remain undecided until sunday ’ s deadline to declare for the draft . <end> <start> the agony of the decision - making process was apparent as he spoke . <end> <start> he clearly was undecided . <end> <start> in discussing his decision wednesday night , mcdermott said he never intended to take so long in making up his mind . <end> <start> “ i apologize for putting people through that , ” he said . <end> <start> in trying to make up his mind , mcdermott said , he put his emotions to a test . <end> <start> he would go through one day with the idea in mind that he was headed for the nba . <end> <start> the next day , he would approach things as if he would be returning to creighton . <end> <start> “ i wanted to see how i felt , ” mcdermott said . <end> <start> “ i found myself waking up the next day feeling a whole lot better when i was thinking about coming back . <end> <start> but i went back and forth more times than you can imagine . ” <end> <start> he said tuesday that he had talked with former creighton all - american kyle korver , now in his 10th season in the nba . <end> <start> mcdermott also sought the counsel of harrison barnes , his former teammate at ames high school who now is wrapping up his rookie season with the golden state warriors . <end> <start> “ he and i talked before the ncaa tournament , and he told me i should go to the nba if i felt i was 100 percent ready , ” mcdermott said . <end> <start> “ that really stuck with me . <end> <start> “ harrison told me that playing in the nba is a completely different world . <end> <start> the money is nice , but you ’ re out there fighting for your job every night . <end> <start> it ’ s not like college , where you ’ re playing for the love of the game and for the fans . ” <end> <start> in the end , those factors appealed more to mcdermott than money . <end> <start> “ i believe i ’ m going to play in the nba , but i have to do it when i feel i ’ m 100 percent ready , ” he said . <end> <start> “ i feel like i have some unfinished business here at creighton . <end> <start> i feel like i can be a lot better , and why not do it here where i can have fun for another year . <end> <start> “ i ’ m so relieved . <end> <start> i feel like a ton of weight has been lifted off my shoulders . <end> <start> i can ’ t put into words how happy i am this is behind me and how excited i am to be coming back . <end> <start> this just feels right . ” <end>

<start> hansbrough broke unc 's career scoring record the carolina way <end> <start> during the spring of 1977 , north carolina coach dean smith invited his star guard phil ford , who had just completed his junior season , into his office . <end> <start> smith told ford that he had done some research on where ford would be selected in the upcoming nba draft. based on that information , he recommended to ford that he leave school . <end> <start> ford did n't even have to think about it . <end> <start> he told smith right away that he was n't interested . <end> <start> `` at the time , a lot of people were n't doing that , so going pro was n't something i had even considered at all , '' ford says . <end> <start> `` the financial situation was different back then as well . <end> <start> at the time , my parents were teachers , so getting my degree was very important to me . <end> <start> the opportunity was n't worth me not getting my degree . '' <end> <start> last april , tyler hansbrough faced a similar decision , but under much different circumstances . <end> <start> hansbrough plays in an era when not only is it common for undergraduates to turn pro , but in some circles a player is considered a failure if he stays past his junior year . <end> <start> needless to say , he faced a financial opportunity much greater than the one ford confronted three decades ago . <end> <start> hansbrough spent two full weeks torturing himself over the impending decision . <end> <start> when hansbrough finally told roy williams he wanted to return for his senior year , he felt like the weight of the world was off his shoulders . <end> <start> he was so relieved that he did n't even leave the weight room when williams asked him to come to his office so they could craft a press release . <end> <start> `` it was a stressful process , '' hansbrough said in mid-october . <end> <start> `` you 're thinking about what you 're going to do with the rest of your life . <end> <start> every time i thought about leaving , i thought about how much i 'd miss coming home , living with my teammates and doing a lot of the fun things we do . <end> <start> i just felt like coming back would be the best situation for me . '' <end> <start> in considering that life decision , it 's doubtful hansbrough gave much thought to the chance he would have to become north carolina 's alltime scoring leader if he returned . <end> <start> still , given the century 's worth of tradition that has reigned in_chapel_hill , it was no small_feat that hansbrough accomplished thursday_night , when he broke ford 's school_career scoring_mark with less_than_eight_minutes to play in the first_half of north_carolina 's game against evansville <end> <start> north carolina has established itself as the gold standard of college basketball , and in the soft-spoken , hard-charging , 6-foot-9 power forward from poplar bluff , missouri , this proud program has a worthy standard bearer . <end> <start> ford is correct when he says that people are n't appreciative enough of hansbrough 's skills , but there is no doubt that what sets this young man apart is the intensity with which he plays . <end> <start> if ford was a classical symphony , hansbrough is a heavy metal rock concert , powering , jostling , banging , and always , always out-hustling his opponent en route to the basket . <end> <start> it is instructive that while hansbrough remains ninth on the acc 's alltime scoring list , he is already the league 's career leader in free throws attempted . <end> <start> if he stays healthy , he will likely leave north carolina as the school 's alltime rebounds king . <end> <start> more than anything , though , tyler hansbrough deserves this record because he came back to school . <end> <start> this is not to disparage players like michael jordan , antawn jamison and rashad mccants who might have had a shot at ford 's mark had they stayed . <end> <start> but at a place like north carolina , which embodies team play , the scoring record should belong to a four-year player . <end> <start> hansbrough would probably not have been a top-five draft pick had he left , but it 's unlikely he will signifcantly improve his draft status by playing another year . <end> <start> also , at the time hansbrough made his decision he was assuming that at least one of his fellow undergraduates , and as many as three of them , would be turning pro , diminishing the tar heels ' chances of winning a championship . <end> <start> hansbrough came back anyway , and for all the right reasons . <end> <start> ford also points out that because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity ball from 1954-73 , a huge swath of mega talents who suited up for unc did n't have the chance to hold onto this record -- including the man ford passed , lenny rosenbluth , who still holds the school 's record for career scoring average ( 26.9 ) and is fourth in points scored . <end> <start> hansbrough is sixth on the school 's career scoring average list at 20.2 . <end> <start> still , it takes a special individual to eclipse a record that has stood at a place like north carolina for 30 years . <end> <start> ford remembers little about the night he passed rosenbluth . <end> <start> he believes he broke the record late in the first half , the game was not interrupted , and neither he nor rosenbluth had much to say about it . <end> <start> in fact , rosenbluth was n't even there that night . <end> <start> when i asked ford if he still has the game ball , he said he thought he might , but he has moved so much in recent years ( he worked as an assistant coach for the detroit pistons and new york knicks before joining the charlotte bobcats last year ) that he thinks the ball may be packed away somewhere . <end> <start> `` to be honest , i was just happy to get it over with , '' ford says . <end> <start> `` i did n't want anything distracting from the team . '' <end> <start> if the circumstances were different than they were in 1978 , the central tenets of the carolina way have endured , from rosenbluth to ford to hansbrough . <end> <start> while offering his congratulations to hansbrough , ford is quick to add that the career scoring record is the least important mark at north carolina . <end> <start> `` we never cared who scored the ball , '' he says , `` as long as someone with the carolina jersey got the ball in the basket . '' <end> <start> tyler hansbrough would be the first to agree , even as he jostles and bangs his way towards history . <end>

" <end> <start> both scientific and religious <end> <start> obama lauded dr . collins' experience in the july 8 announcement . <end> <start> "dr . collins is one of the top scientists in the world , and his groundbreaking work has changed the very ways we consider our health and examine disease .

" <end> <start> the hastings center's murray said that if dr . collins ever made a mistake , it may be that he was a bit overly enthusiastic when describing the potential for breakthroughs when he was leading the human genome project . <end> <start> still , "i can't fault the scientist who really believes in their work for being enthusiastic as they talk to congress , " murray said . <end> <start> dr . collins has garnered attention by professing that his belief in god can coexist with his pursuit of science . <end> <start> he's written books on the topic , including the 2007 best - seller the language of god : a scientist presents evidence for belief . <end> <start> he is also founder and president of the biologos foundation , whose purpose is to find compatibility between the scientific and religious searches for truth . <end> <start> in an interview with the spiritual web site beliefnet in 2007 , dr . collins said christians who reject scientific evolutionary theory are also rejecting humans' ability to understand , a god - given skill . <end> <start> but there are limits to the questions science can answer , such as why we are here or what happens after death , he said . <end> <start> william hurlbut , md , a consulting professor of neuroscience at stanford university and a former member of president george w . bush's council on bioethics , said the idea that science and religion can't coexist is ridiculous . <end> <start> "a person with francis' background is a very wise choice" for nih chief , he said . <end>

<start> 'doctor_who' : peter_capaldi announced as the new doctor <end> <start> august_4_,_2013_2_:_29_pm_et <end> <start> after lots of speculation , peter_capaldi has been named the new doctor for series_8 of "doctor_who .

<start> peter_capaldi favourite to take_over from matt_smith as doctor_who <end> <start> wednesday_31_jul_2013_11_:_20_am <end> <start> peter_capaldi is the bookies' favourite to become the next doctor_who . <end> <start> there has been a surge in bets on capaldi , who plays sweary spin doctor malcom_tucker in the_thick_of_it , replacing matt_smith , according_to william_hill . <end> <start> joe crilly , a spokesperson for william hill , said : 'peter capaldi was not even in our list a few days ago but he has been the subject of a lot of betting interest recently and this gamble would suggest that if he does not have the part already , he is almost certainly on the shortlist . ' <end> <start> he now has odds of 2 / 1 to become the 12th time lord above ben daniels and rory kinnear . <end> <start> previous favourite kinnear has slipped down the list after he ruled himself out of the running , claiming he's never seen an episode of doctor who . <end> <start> capaldi's name may have been linked to the role after doctor who creator steven moffat said he would not rule out casting an older doctor . <end> <start> he said at the recent san diego comic - con : 'we've never not considered an older doctor . <end> <start> it is completely on all the lists we make - there are absolutely older doctors .

<start> 26-year-old matt_smith has been cast as the next incarnation of the doctor . <end> <start> users on the facebook doctor who forum that i frequent mostly had the same reaction : `` who 's matt smith ? '' <end> <start> the guy is relatively unknown and the skeptics wondered if the right_person was chosen . <end> <start> after all , everyone speculated that paterson joseph , who had appeared on a couple episodes of the show , was going to be the next doctor and here we get some no-name . <end>
<start> peter_capaldi as 'doctor_who' : a return to distinguished tradition ? <end> <start> aug_._05_,_2013_|_2_:_47_p_._m . <end> <start> and as the world ( or one obsessed subset thereof ) watched , the name of the person to play the twelfth doctor - though not , of course , the name of the doctor , which shall remain unspoken - was revealed . <end> <start> peter_capaldi , the bookmakers' choice by a wide margin , will take_over for the retiring matt_smith_,_the_doctor since 2010 . <end> <start> smith's doctor will regenerate into capaldi's - same character , just a different body - this_christmas . <end> <start> the new star of "doctor_who" is best known to americans , which is not to say well known , as the f_-_bombing spin_doctor in armando iannucci's political comedies "the_thick_of_it" ( bbc series ) and "in_the_loop" ( film spinoff ) and , reaching back through the foggy mists_of_time , for bill forsyth's gentle comedy of scotland , "local_hero . " <end> <start> he is , at any rate , better known to us than were his immediate predecessors , christopher eccleston , david tennant and smith , when they assumed the role . <end> <start> he has twice appeared in the whoniverse , as a first - century businessman in "the_fires_of_pompeii" and a tragic figure at the center of the spun - off "torchwood" miniseries , "children_of_earth . " <end> <start> he also appears in "world war z" as a world health organization , or who , doctor . <end> <start> you felt a little chill then , didn't you ? <end> <start> the announcement came sunday , after months of public speculation and wish - listing , conspiratorial sifting of coincidence and readings of tea leaves , near the end of "doctor who live : the next doctor , " a bbc special that aired here simultaneously on bbc america . <end> <start> it is not to be confused with the big 50th anniversary special set for november . <end> <start> with fifth doctor peter davison ( the cricket - sweater doctor ) and elderly companion bernard cribbens as its main in - studio star power and a floating tardis ( police - box shaped time machine , for the uninitiated ) introduced as a "special guest , " it was , global interest aside , a small - scale , essentially local , even provincial , event . <end> <start> because whatever else the new doctor would turn out to be - and , if recent history was any guide he would turn out to be tall , thin , white , clean - shaven , not bald and unconventionally attractive ( check , check , check , check , check and check ) - it was going to be somebody british . <end> <start> as does james bond , "doctor who" posits a world in which the u . k . is still at the center of things . <end> <start> it's where the aliens arrive , and the earth is repeatedly saved . <end> <start> some had hoped for a black doctor ( idris elba was often named ) , or a female doctor ( olivia colman , perhaps ) , and as with other great and important offices , it does seem only right that it be open to anyone , regardless of gender or color . <end> <start> indeed , if it seemed just possible this time , it's hard to believe the next doctor won't break one of those lines , or both . <end> <start> that capaldi is an award - winning actor of great reputation does not necessarily mean that it will be any easier for him to take control of the tardis . <end> <start> every new doctor represents a testing of the brand and a testing of the faithful ; there are viewers still mourning the loss of david tennant ( no . 10 ) , and undoubtedly some who feel nothing's been as good since tom baker ( no . 4 ) quit , back in 1981 . <end> <start> it is also , and not incidentally , a test of the show runner , steven moffat , who came in with smith , following series - rebooter russell t davies . <end> <start> show runners are a thing we know about now ; we know whom to blame , and moffat draws a fair share . <end> <start> still , first reactions seem on the whole approving , though some younger online commenters bemoaned capaldi's age - 55 , the age of william hartnell when he created the role , back in 1963 . <end> <start> fangirls who crushed on the younger eccleston , tennant and / or smith wondered how they would adapt to a doctor old enough to be their dad . <end> <start> there is , of course , plenty of precedent for gray - haired swashbucklers ( your gandalf , actually called gray , your obi - wan kenobi , your very vibrant third doctor , john pertwee ) . <end> <start> and moffat can always create companions for raw youth appeal , as was the original custom . <end> <start> ( hartnell's doctor traveled with a granddaughter . ) <end> <start> certainly , capaldi represents a change from matt smith - thought by some to be too young for the part when he took over , ironically - but he also offers a range of new tonal possibilities , some of which are also old possibilities . <end> <start> moffat may be more of a "who" classicist than davies , who brought sex , romance and a will - they - won't - they element to the series . <end> <start> it may be time for the return of a more fatherly doctor . <end> <start> if you look back across the whole life of the series , capaldi seems very much in the tradition - a likely , almost obvious choice . <end> <start> he has the authority , the madness , the sweetness . <end> <start> at the same time , we don't know how moffat plans to write him . <end> <start> the doctor is as constant as the stars and as changeable as the wind ; he is a warrior clown , comical and stern , a thousand - year - old child , a tenderhearted soul who loves humanity and yet is renowned across the universe as the scourge of worlds . <end> <start> ( typically , these are worlds that deserve a scourge . ) <end> <start> there is a lot of room to play in there . <end> <start> fans - especially british fans , whose allegiance spans decades and generations , speak of "my doctor" as if every citizen needs to have a favorite - do have strong ideas about what the doctor should be . <end> <start> but variety is in his nature , and in choosing to take this ride , we agree to accept the authenticity of the latest anointed choice - a choice no more in our hands , after all , than it is in the doctor's . <end> <start> he is always surprised by who he next finds himself to be . <end> <start> for most viewers the doctor shapes himself to the actor , even as the actor shapes the part . <end> <start> you want to honor the tradition , naturally , and you can't afford to alienate your audience . <end> <start> still , fear of change is a poor basis for creative decision - the point , moffat told hero complex recently , was to bring the world around : 'you want people to go , 'no , that would never work ! ' . . . <end> <start> and they always get wrenched out of their comfort zone , and then they find the doctor again . <end> <start> and there's such a range of what the doctor can be . " <end> <start> i'm excited . <end>

'' <end> <start> soon , with co-author james swanson , i embarked on the adventure of writing her biography , sitting down with her for hundreds of hours while she told us her story . <end> <start> at the time , i was also trying to work out how to tell the stories of women in history who had been either dropped from the record or misinterpreted through the sexist lens of their biographers . <end> <start> i was to start with kleopatra ( the original greek spelling ) , a victim of roman propaganda remembered for the men with whom she slept rather than for her diplomacy , leadership , and the fact that she had mastered nine languages . <end> <start> how to present the stories of women who had been victimized without writing a victim story , i kept asking myself ? <end> <start> how to give women in history who had been reduced to their sexuality the full breadth of their experience without diminishing or demeaning their sexuality ? <end> <start> so here was bettie page , a woman known only for her sexuality , who had been sexually abused by her father , sexually violated by a gang of strangers , and emotionally battered by a husband . <end> <start> in the years since she had gone underground , bettie had become a born-again christian working for the billy graham crusade . <end> <start> surely she would repudiate the work she 'd done as a pin-up and bondage model . <end> <start> surely she saw herself as a victim of the patriarchy that hijacked her beauty and sensuality and exploited it for its own gratification . <end> <start> surely i was about to meet a woman who considered herself a victim . <end> <start> i was wrong . <end> <start> despite her more unfortunate experiences , bettie never presented herself as a casualty of sexual abuse , and she never used that , or her religious beliefs , which were strong , to renounce the work she 'd done as a model . <end> <start> moreover , she never denounced sexual expression . <end> <start> `` god created us naked , '' she said by way of explaining her total lack of inhibition in the buff . <end> <start> she purported that bondage modeling `` was such fun , '' even at times `` hilarious , '' except for when the elaborate gear became uncomfortable . <end> <start> and sex itself , she assured me on many occasions , was for her , always pleasurable and joyful . <end> <start> though she had at times suffered at their hands , she never expressed bitterness toward men . <end> <start> i know women who are resoundingly more hostile than bettie page just for having suffered a few bad dates . <end> <start> no , bettie was not going to allow anyone or anything to diminish the joy she experienced when she put that corset on ( or took it off ) and felt her full-blown sexual power . <end> <start> since the publication of bettie page : life of a pin-up legend , i have published four historical novels with strong female characters . <end> <start> each , in her own way , was a victim , either of the era in which she lived and its laws , or of individual abusers , or of the general abuses and oppressive nature of the culture at large . <end> <start> despite the enormous consciousness-raising of the last few decades , we still see attempts to diminish today 's female powerbrokers women like hillary clinton or sarah palin by sexualizing them . <end> <start> yes , in our porn-saturated society , people are still trying to shame women for -- what ? <end> <start> having sexual attributes ? <end> <start> at least we can point to one woman , bettie page , who would n't have it . <end> <start> bettie 's obits paint a bleak picture of her later years . <end> <start> but i found that , despite her trials , she had retained a zest for life and always took pleasure in memories of the work that she 'd done . <end> <start> i hope that bettie is remembered for her sexual joy , and for the gleeful spirit she brought to sexual imagery , whether she was frolicking on the beach or being ball-gagged and spanked , rather than for being a victim . <end> <start> a female friend of mine said this morning , `` bettie page did more for sexual expression than alfred kinsey. '' amen , sister . <end> <start> for all the countless ( and valuable ) mountains of scholarly and feminist writing that have influenced my thinking and my portrayal of women , i still look to a lady who said it all by looking into the camera and defying anyone to tell her she was bad or wrong . <end> <start> amen to you , too , bettie . <end> <start> rest in peace . <end>

<start> after weeks of speculation about what would be introduced at macworld , apple_inc. took_the_wraps_off of updated itunes and ilife software and unveiled a 17-inch macbook_pro on_tuesday . <end> <start> the cupertino , calif.-based company ( nasdaq : aapl ) said itunes songs will now have three-tiered pricing : 69 cents , 99 cents and $ 1.29 , depending on how new or desirable the songs are judged to be . <end> <start> all songs offered on itunes plus will be free of digital rights management software . <end> <start> users of the popular itunes service will now also be able to download music over wifi and 3g networks on the iphone . <end> <start> apple claims that its new macbook pro is the thinnest and lightest 17-inch notebook computer available . <end> <start> its new battery can run for up to eight hours on a charge and can be rechagred up to 1,000 times , the company said . <end> <start> the new notebook is expected to ship in late january with a price tag of $ 2,799 for the base model that will have 4 gigabytes of ram and a 320 gigabyte hard drive . <end> <start> the new version of ilife includes changes to its photo , movie and music software . <end> <start> the updated iphoto lets users tag photos according to who is in them or where they were taken . <end> <start> the places feature either picks up the tag from a camera 's gps system or the information can be put in manually . <end> <start> the new iphoto software also supports photos tagging at social networking sites facebook and flickr . <end> <start> the second revamped ilife offering unveiled at apple 's keynote tuesday morning was a new version of imovie , which allows new drag-and-drop editing features , video stabilization , built-in themes and animated travel maps . <end> <start> ilife 's new version of garageband music software adds hd video tutorials for guitar and piano taught by pop stars including sting and norah jones . <end> <start> apple also rolled out an updated version of iwork that includes a new online service that lets users share documents over the web . <end> <start> delivering the keynote address at the macworld trade show was apple 's top marketing executive , philip schiller , who spoke in the place of ceo steve jobs . <end> <start> on monday jobs ended weeks of new speculation about his health with an open letter saying that he has a hormonal imbalance that has caused him to lose weight . <end> <start> last month apple said jobs would n't be making his highly-anticipated annual appearance at the show , a report that renewed rumors about his health that surfaced when he appeared gaunt earlier in the year . <end>
<start> apple unveils new macbook_pro with ivy_bridge at wwdc <end> <start> posted jun_11th_,_2012_at_1_:_23_pm <end> <start> apple is certainly making wwdc a hardware conference this_year - - it just unveiled a refresh of the existing macbook_pro running intel's newer ivy_bridge_processors on the san_francisco_gathering's opening_day . <end> <start> the 13 - and 15 - inch portables run up to 2 . 7ghz quad core i7s ( turbo up to 3 . 7ghz ) , carry up to 8gb of ram and have geforce gt 650m - based graphics 60 percent faster than the previous generation . <end> <start> like the new macbook_air , they tout usb_3_._0_ports . <end> <start> if you're more comfortable with apple's conventional macbook_pro design than the new_variety , apple will ask $1 , 099 for the base 13_-_inch_version and $1 , 799 for a 15_-_inch_version , with an upgraded 15_-_inch_model going for $2 , 199 . <end> <start> all of them are shipping today - - we're not seeing any mention of an updated 17 - inch version , so it may have been cast aside . <end>
<start> apple 's big announcement at macworld yesterday was not a new imac , mini or netbook , all of which had been rumoured , but a battery . <end> <start> the firm announced a widely expected refresh of its 17in macbook_pro , with a battery that the firm said will offer eight_hours of operation , but which is not removable from the case . <end> <start> the battery , based on conventional lithium polymer technology commonly found in laptops and mobile phones , has been integrated into the case to make the device thinner while increasing battery life , according to apple senior vice president of marketing phil schiller . <end> <start> apple has also introduced a separate chip that monitors the power used by each cell and adjusts the charging current accordingly , which the firm says extends the life of the battery . <end> <start> the macworld crowd did not let out its characteristic whoops of excitement when schiller announced the battery , even when he said that its capacity for 1,000 full recharges - three times the average achieved by other notebooks - would give the average battery a five-year life . <end> <start> however , one mac customer from the show floor was sceptical of the claims . <end> <start> `` apple says five years , but for some it might only be two or three , '' he said . <end> <start> `` look at the way guys like us travel . '' <end> <start> apple will offer a p135 take-back and replacement service for the battery . <end> <start> the keynote was decidedly low-key this year , being apple 's last following a decision to pull out from the idg-run show . <end> <start> other than the macbook pro , the company concentrated on enhancements to its iwork package , including a beta version of iwork.com . <end> <start> the service lets users share iwork files , including those in microsoft office format , and to comment on each other 's work . <end> <start> glaringly absent at macworld were refreshes of the now ageing mac mini and the imac desktop lines . <end>
<start> new macbook_air models officially unveiled with ivy_bridge upgrade <end> <start> as rumored , new 11_-_inch and 13_-_inch macbook_air models have just been officially announced by apple at wwdc_2012 . <end> <start> unsurprisingly , apple is keeping pace with competitors with the addition of ivy_bridge to its slimmest line of laptops . <end> <start> the 11 - inch models will start at $999 with a 1 . 7ghz dual - core intel core i5 processor , 4gb ram , integrated intel hd 4000 graphics , 64gb flash storage , and 5 hours of battery life , with a higher - tier model for $1099 that contains 128gb of flash storage . <end> <start> the 13 - inch models start at $1 , 199 and include the same 1440 x 900 display as the previous models , along with a 1 . 8ghz dual - core i5 processor , 4gb of ram , the same graphics as the 11 - inch model , and 128gb of storage . <end> <start> $1499 will get you an extra 256gb of storage ; specs are the same otherwise . <end> <start> apple has also opted to include a pair of usb_3_._0_ports in its new air lineup . <end> <start> apple says the new 11_-_inch and 13_-_inch macbook_air models are available now . <end>
<start> apple on_tuesday launched a refresh of the 17-inch macbook_pro , giving the company 's largest laptop an eight-hour battery_life , a faster intel ( nsdq : intc ) processor , and better graphics_capabilities . <end> <start> the upgraded product was the only hardware announcement at the opening macworld keynote , which was delivered by phil schiller , senior vp for worldwide product marketing at apple . <end> <start> breaking with tradition , the company announced late last month that co-founder and chief executive steve jobs would not kick off the trade show . <end> <start> in addition , apple stunned the industry by saying this year would be its last appearance at macworld . <end> <start> the absence of jobs led many analysts to believe that apple would not make any major product announcements , and the prediction turned out to be correct , particularly in terms of hardware . <end> <start> the macbook was the only apple computer to get an upgrade , which is sure to disappoint fans who had also hoped for updates to the company 's mac mini and apple tv . <end> <start> apple observers had expected the refresh of the 17-inch macbook pro , given that it was left out of apple 's notebook event in october , when the company launched updates of the 15-inch and 13.3-inch systems . <end> <start> but while some analysts said the larger laptop could get a big speed boost with an intel quad-core processor , apple stuck with an intel dual-core chip , which has been upgraded to a 2.66-ghz core 2 duo processor with 6 mb of on-chip l2 cache . <end> <start> buyers also have the option of a 2.93-ghz core 2 duo processor . <end> <start> but the most innovative feature in the upgrade is a new battery that apple claims will last up to eight hours on a single charge and can be recharged up to 1,000 times , which means up to a five-year lifespan . <end> <start> rivalsdell ( dell ) and hewlett-packard ( nyse : hpq ) last year introduced laptops with similar battery life on a single charge . <end> <start> the apple battery achieves its better performance by using custom-designed lithium-polymer cells that are 40 % larger than the previous generation . <end> <start> however , to fit the battery in the system , apple has made it nonremovable , which may turn off some potential buyers . <end> <start> because of the extended lifespan of the battery , apple says the macbook is more environmentally friendly than the previous generation , since the power supply does n't have to be replaced so often . <end> <start> the notebook is less than an inch thick , weighs 6.6 pounds , and features a light-emitting diode screen with a $ 50 anti-glare option . <end> <start> in addition , the system comes with an nvidia geforce 9400m integrated graphics processor and a discrete nvidia 9600m gt processor . <end> <start> switching to the latter gives better graphics performance at the expense of about an hour of battery life . <end>
<start> apple unveils new macbook_pro with ivy_bridge at wwdc <end> <start> ? apple is certainly making wwdc a hardware conference this_year - - it just unveiled a new macbook_pro running intel's newer ivy_bridge_processors on the san_francisco_gathering's opening_day . ? <end> <start> i have used a broken mouse on my macbook pro for &gt; 6 months in anticipation of this . . . . <end> <start> now if that pesky store . apple . com would just come back online ! <end>
<start> with a 17-inch macbook_pro update unveiled at today 's macworld_2009_keynote , apple has finally brought an entire line of mac_portables into view . <end> <start> the largest member of the macbook family now comes with a faster front-side bus and processor , nvidia graphics , displayport interconnect with hdcp content protection , led-backlit glossy display , and all of it wrapped up inside apple 's unibody aluminum enclosure with glass trackpad . <end> <start> for the first time ever , apple is also offering a 256gb sdd upgrade , while creative pros get to order anti-glare display version of the computer . <end> <start> but everybody was expecting this . <end> <start> what was never dreamed of is eight hours of battery life that powers this beast - up from five hours before . <end> <start> the added juice comes from a 40 % larger battery and a chip inside that `` talks '' to each cell and adjusts the current accordingly . <end> <start> this results in three times the number of charges and lifespan of the industry standard . <end> <start> the rumor mill was way off this year when it predicted a $ 600 mac netbook or iphone nano as apple 's `` one more thing '' for macworld 2009 . <end> <start> instead , apple 's vice president of worldwide marketing phil schiller , appointed by steve jobs to deliver the keynote presentation in his absence , saved the new 17-inch macbook pro as the company 's last surprise . <end> <start> apple calls the 17-inch macbook pro the `` world 's lightest and thinnest 17-inch notebook , '' and it is n't exaggerating . <end> <start> the computer is just 0.98-inches thin and weighs 6.6 pounds. the 17-inch macbook pro represents a marriage of all the technologies used to build other unibody macbooks and a large 17-inch display for applications that require lots of screen real estate , like video editing and graphics design on-the-go . <end> <start> the machine features led-backlit glossy display that lights up instantly when the lid is open , unlike warm up time required for the lcd cells . <end> <start> it also features built-in isight camera and 1920 x 1200 resolution - that 's 78 percent more pixels than the 15-inch macbook pro and enough to display full 1080p hd content with room to spare . <end> <start> in addition , it has a 700:1 contrast ratio and 60 % greater color gamut . <end> <start> as was expected , the machine now relies exclusively on mini displayport interconnect with hdcp copy protection technology , and it comes with glass trackpad and illuminated keyboard , all wrapped in a sturdy unibody alluminum enclosure . <end> <start> the new 17-inch macbook pro includes an ultra-thin , widescreen glossy 1920 x 1200 display with 78 % more pixels than the 15-inch macbook pro and a 60 % greater color gamut that delivers desktop-quality color in a notebook . <end> <start> the led-backlit display has brilliant instant-on performance , uses up to 30 % less energy and eliminates the mercury found in industry standard fluorescent tube backlights . <end> <start> a faster 1066 mhz front-side bus and newer generation of intel core 2 duo processor with 6mb shared l2 cache , clocked at 2.66 ghz , bring an evolutionary speed increase over the previous model . <end> <start> the notebook ships with 4gb of 1066 mhz ddr3 sdram , expandable to 8gb ; onboard graphics is the same ( nvidia geforce 9400m and 9600m gt combo ) as used in the 15-inch unibody macbook pro models . <end> <start> the latter discreet chip comes with 512mb gddr3 video memory and can be turned on to boost graphics performance when needed , albeit at the expense of battery . <end> <start> but when it comes to battery , the lithium polymer one inside the 17-inch macbook pro squeezes up to 8 hours of runtime . <end> <start> apple said it created 40 % larger environment-friendly battery without taxing computer 's sleek form factor . <end> <start> the battery features adaptive charging technology and comes with a chip inside that talks to each cell to adjust the current accordingly , resulting in a three times the charges and lifespan of the industry standard . <end> <start> `` we 've developed new battery technology that is better for the user and better for the environment , '' said apple ceo steve jobs . <end> <start> `` apple 's advanced chemistry and innovative technology deliver up to eight hours of use on a full charge cycle and up to 1,000 recharges . '' <end> <start> the company claims that a `` properly maintained '' battery in this notebook will retain 80 % or more of its original capacity during a lifespan of up to 1,000 recharge cycles . <end> <start> connectivity options include wireless 802.11n networking courtesy of the built-in airport extreme card , a bluetooth 2.1 + edr module and gigabit ethernet . <end> <start> the machine also has one firewire 800 port for connecting video cameras and other professional audio and video equipment , three usb 2.0 ports , audio line in and out ports , each supporting both digital and analog , and expresscard/34 expansion card slot . <end> <start> storage features include 320gb sata hdd running at 5400 rpm , with apple 's sudden motion sensor that prevents head to scratch platter surface if the machine is suddenly dropped , and a slot-load 8x superdrive with double-layer support . <end> <start> apple will start shipping the new 17-inch macbook pro at the end of the month for $ 2,799 . <end>
<start> apple launches new macbook_pros with ivy_bridge , from $1 , 199 <end> <start> apple's new macbook_pros come with ivy_bridge_processors and the nvidia_geforce_gt650m_graphics_card . <end> <start> june_11_,_2012_10_:_24_am_pdt <end> <start> apple today launch its new macbook_pro_line . <end> <start> announced at the company's worldwide developers conference keynote , the new macbook_pros will boast third - generation ivy_bridge_processors and the nvidia_geforce_gt650m_graphics . <end> <start> the line also includes both usb_2_._0 and usb_3_._0_support <end> <start> unlike apple's next - generation macbook pro , its 13 - and 15 - inch macbook pros don't come with the retina display . <end> <start> instead , the 13 - inch version boasts 1 , 280 x 800 resolution , and comes with the 2 . 5ghz dual - core intel core i5 processor . <end> <start> the 15 - inch macbook pro offers a larger 1 , 440 x 900 display and starts out with a 2 . 3ghz quad - core intel core i7 chip . <end> <start> other than that , the differences across apple's macbook pro line aren't all that major . <end> <start> both the 13 - and 15_-_inch_options come with 500gb of storage , and deliver seven_hours of battery_life . <end> <start> the cheapest 13 - and 15 - inch macbook pros start with 4gb of ram . <end> <start> apple's new macbook_pro line starts at $1 , 199 for the 13_-_inch_option , but can go much higher . <end> <start> the 15_-_inch_macbook_pro starts_off at $1 , 799 . <end> <start> both devices are available now . <end>

<start> apple unveils cheaper ivy_bridge - powered macbook_air <end> <start> june_12_,_2012 <end> <start> apple has chosen wwdc week to announce an update to its macbook_air_line . <end> <start> it may lack the retina display of its newly upgraded , headline - grabbing cousin , the macbook pro , but the 2012 air sees significant advances too . <end> <start> an upgrade from sandy_bridge to ivy_bridge_processors with improved integrated_graphics is chief among the upgrades , and onboard_memory has also received a boost . <end> <start> what hasn't changed is the ultra - thin form factor and ( with the thick end of the wedge maxing out at 0 . 68 in or 17 mm ) , weighing in at 2 . 38 pounds ( 1 . 08 kg ) for the 11 - inch model and 2 . 96 pounds ( 1 . 35 kg ) for the 13 - inch . <end> <start> battery performance remains as is ( which is no bad thing ) , with a touted 5 and 7 hours for the smaller and larger models respectively while wirelessly browsing the web . <end> <start> what's new is an upgrade from sandy bridge to the faster ivy bridge processor , which brings with it a switch up from intel hd graphics 3000 to intel hd graphics 4000 . <end> <start> this should bring with it a noticeable performance boost , though its doubtful that hardcore gamers will be rushing to buy the new airs as portable gaming rigs this year . <end> <start> the included random access memory allowance has doubled from 2 to 4 gb ( configurable to 8 gb ) , and has been upgraded to lower voltage 1600 - mhz ddr3l sdram . <end> <start> flash storage remains at 64 gb and 128 gb in the entry - level 11 - and 13 - inch models respectively , though this is now configurable up to 512 gb . <end> <start> connectivity sees a significant boost with the inclusion of two_usb_3_._0_ports in addition to the thunderbolt_port . <end> <start> the usb 3 . 0 standard allows data transfer more than ten times the speed of usb 2 . 0 . <end> <start> the power connection has been upgraded to apple's magsafe 2 , which is simply an even smaller version of the magsafe port that lets the power cable disconnected safely in the event of jarring cable snag , preventing unwelcome macbook / floor interface scenarios . <end> <start> though the 11 - inch air still starts at us$999 , the 13 - inch has dropped $100 to $1199 , making it all the more compelling to laptop - hunters on the prowl for an ultrabook . <end>
<start> apple ceo steve_jobs unveiled the company 's new high-end notebook line during the special event being held at_apple_'s_headquarters in_cupertino_,_calif . <end> <start> the new macbook pro will feature two graphic chipsets , the nvidia geforce 9400m embedded on the motherboard and the nvidia geforce 9600m as a discrete part . <end> <start> the graphics deliver 32 parallel graphics cores and 125 gigaflops of graphics performance. jobs said that using the 9400m you get five hours of battery life and four hours with the 9600m . <end> <start> apple tests indicate the new graphics are five times faster than the integrated graphics of the current designs . <end> <start> the macbook pro will also come with a newly designed trackpad . <end> <start> the multitouch glass trackpad has a 39 percent larger tracking area than before , according to jobs . <end> <start> the entire trackpad will act as button , rather than having a separate button like the previous notebooks . <end> <start> apple has also added to its arsenal of multitouch gestures , adding four-finger gestures with the latest release . <end> <start> all of the connectors are on the left side of the macbook pro and features a unibody enclosure . <end> <start> apple designer jonathan ive explained that apple learned a lot when making the macbook air and used that knowledge to design the new macbook pro . <end> <start> of course , the macbook pro will have all the features you 've come to expect from an apple notebook like like backlit keyboards , magnetic latch , motion sensor , speakers , isight and microphone . <end> <start> apple is also adding a mini display port on the new models . <end> <start> a slot-loading superdrive will be on the right-hand side of the macbook pro . <end> <start> at less than an inch thick the new macbook pro will come in two models . <end> <start> for $ 1999 you get a 15.4-inch 2.4ghz intel core 2 duo with 3mb l2 cache , an led-backlit display and 2gb 1066 mhz ddr 3 memory , both nvidia cards , a 250gb hard drive and the slot-loading superdrive . <end> <start> the other model costs $ 2499 and comes with 2.53ghz processor , 6mb l2 , 4gb of memory , 512mb on the nvidia 9600m gt , 320gb hard drive . <end> <start> the previous generation 15-inch macbook pro also came in two models : a 2.4ghz and a 2.5ghz intel core 2 duo . <end> <start> those systems came with a 200gb and 250gb hard drive respectively . <end> <start> although not discussed in detail today , the 17-inch macbook pro was also updated-not a complete makeover as with the 15-inch macbook pro , but more of a minor update . <end> <start> the system continues to use the same chassis design as before , and does n't have the glass-touch trackpad . <end> <start> one key change is that the old native screen resolution of 1680 x 1050 has been discontinued-every 17-inch macbook pro now comes with the 1920 x 1200 screen , in either ( standard ) glossy ( no-cost option ) matte form . <end> <start> while cpu speeds remain the same ( 2.5ghz stock , and $ 250 for an upgrade to 2.6ghz ) , ram has been increased from 2gb to 4gb ( the maximum possible ) , and the hard drive size has increased to 320gb from 250gb . <end> <start> the standard drive is still a 5400rpm model , with ( as before ) the option of a 320gb 7200rpm drive . <end> <start> new to the 17-inch macbook pro , however , is an optional 128gb solid-state drive , as used in the updated macbook air . <end> <start> the macbook pros are shipping today . <end>

<start> apple_inc on_tuesday_(_jan_6 ) introduced what it claims to be the world 's thinnest and lightest 17-inch laptop with a new unibody aluminium enclosure and a built-in battery said to deliver up to eight_hours of use and a lifespan three times longer than conventional laptop batteries . <end> <start> it also announced a revamp of its ilife suite of digital lifestyle software at the macworld expo trade show here , in particular the iphoto photo management software which now comes with face detection technology and built-in support for facebook . <end> <start> consumers can also teach themselves to play musical instruments with the new version of garageband music creation software . <end> <start> conspicuously missing from this year 's expo is the company 's iconic ceo steve jobs , who is recuperating from a health problem . <end> <start> his place as keynote presenter was taken over by vice-president of worldwide product marketing phil schiller . <end> <start> in a two hour-long keynote , schiller showcased the star attraction of the expo , the top-of-the-line 17-inch apple macbook pro that now features a design similar to apple 's two other laptops , the 13-inch macbook and the 15-inch macbook pro . <end> <start> its body , carved out of a single block of aluminium , measures just 2.5cm thick . <end> <start> the laptop weighs less than 2.99kg . <end> <start> a high resolution , low power consumption led-backlit display and a large button-less trackpad made of glass has now made its way into the laptop as well . <end> <start> a new built-in battery powers the laptop for eight hours on a single charge . <end> <start> touted as the greenest notebook family , the new macbook pro 's battery allows up to 1,000 recharges for more than three times the lifespan of conventional laptop batteries . <end> <start> the typical lifespan for laptop batteries is about three years . <end> <start> the new 17-inch macbook pro will retail in malaysia for rm10,099 . <end> <start> iphoto , one of five digital lifestyle software in the ilife 09 suite now , has new features called places and faces . <end> <start> places automatically imports photo location data from a gps-enabled camera or an apple iphone , while with faces , iphoto automatically scans photos to detect people 's faces and when names are assigned to those faces , iphoto will find more pictures of that person . <end> <start> taking things a step further , a button in iphoto enables not just convenient publishing of photos on photo sharing websites such as facebook and flickr , but also to detect even more faces on the internet . <end> <start> calling them `` really powerful '' , schiller demonstrated how these features help organise thousands of photos . <end> <start> the updated garageband 09 allows budding musicians to learn to play the piano and guitar at their own pace . <end> <start> basic lessons allow newbies to learn the fundamentals while a feature called artist lessons has original artists including john fogerty , colbie caillat , norah jones and sting showing how to play their hit songs . <end> <start> `` ilife has become one of the reasons people buy a mac today . <end> <start> there 's nothing like it on any other computing platform , '' said schiller . <end> <start> priced at rm299 for single user , ilife 09 will ship end of january . <end> <start> also announced at macworld were updates to the company 's iwork office productivity suite . <end> <start> called iwork 09 , the three software that makes up the suite , namely keynote , pages and numbers have received new themes , sophisticated transition effects and a quick way to group and summarise data . <end> <start> iwork 09 is available immediately for rm299 . <end> <start> the `` one more thing '' announcement -- jobs ' trademark way of announcing something unexpected -- was reserved for a new three-tier pricing for apple 's itunes online music store which is not available in malaysia . <end> <start> jobs , who survived a pancreatic cancer in 2004 and appeared to be losing weight throughout 2008 , on monday ( jan 5 ) wrote a personal letter addressed to the apple community , saying doctors have pinpointed hormone imbalance as the reason for his illness . <end> <start> `` the remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and i 've already begun treatment , '' he wrote , adding that he would remain as apple 's ceo and expects to be back in shape by spring this year . <end>
<start> apple unveils new macbook_pro with ivy_bridge at wwdc <end> <start> june 12th , 2012 <end> <start> apple is certainly making wwdc a hardware conference this_year - it just unveiled a refresh of the existing macbook_pro running intel's newer ivy_bridge_processors on the san_francisco_gathering's opening_day . <end> <start> the 13 - and 15 - inch portables run up to 2 . 7ghz quad core i7s ( turbo up to 3 . 7ghz ) , carry up to 8gb of ram and have geforce gt 650m - based graphics 60 percent faster than the previous generation . <end> <start> like the new macbook_air , they tout usb_3_._0_ports . <end> <start> if you're more comfortable with apple's conventional macbook_pro design than the new variety , apple will ask $1 , 099 for the base 13_-_inch_version and $1 , 799 for a 15_-_inch_version , with an upgraded 15_-_inch_model going for $2 , 199 . <end> <start> all of them are shipping today - we're not seeing any mention of an updated 17 - inch version , so it may have been cast aside . <end>
<start> the only hardware release at macworld_expo_2009 was a predictable unibody upgrade for the 17-inch macbook_pro , which apple reports will have an eight-hour battery_life . <end> <start> eight hours is surely impressive for such a large , powerful notebook . <end> <start> but this news is nonetheless underwhelming for several reasons . <end> <start> some thought apple was strategically waiting so it could ship the 17-inch macbook pro with a low-cost , quad-core processor . <end> <start> intel released such a chip just recently , and apc suspected this cpu would appear in apple 's top-of-the-line notebook . <end> <start> but much to our disappointment , the 17-incher is shipping with a plain ol ' dual-core ( core 2 duo ) chip . <end> <start> true , at 2.66 ghz it 's slightly faster than the other macbook pros . <end> <start> but there are hardly any substantial changes to justify the longer wait for this notebook . <end> <start> apple was able to beef up the macbook pro 's battery by taking advantage of the generous amount of space available in the notebook 's enclosure . <end> <start> this battery is also non-removable , which apple said was necessary to use as much space as possible . <end> <start> apple also claims the new macbook pro 's battery is more environmentally friendly because it lasts five years and has fewer toxins . <end> <start> looks like our apple source , and several others in various blogs , were incorrect about the rumor of a new mac mini launching at macworld . <end> <start> we 'll look into the reasons why and provide an update soon . <end>
<start> apple intros new macbook_pro , blurs line between tablet , computer <end> <start> monday_,_june_11th_,_2012_at_10_:_49_am <end> <start> apple has unveiled the next_generation_of_macbook_pro at the wwdc_keynote in_san_francisco . <end> <start> the 15_._4″_macbook_pro refresh will be remarkably thin , at 0 . 71″ and at 4 . 46 pounds , it will be the thinnest and lightest macbook_pro ever . <end> <start> the display is where the macbook pro refresh truly shines , with a retina display at a whopping 2 , 880 by 1 , 800 pixels . <end> <start> that amounts to 5 , 184 , 000 pixels and 220 ppi , 4 times the current pixel count in the existing macbook pros . <end> <start> apple touts it as the world's highest - resolution notebook display . <end> <start> all stock mac applications have been updated to support the retina display on the new macbook pro , as well as several other popular applications including aperture , final cut pro , and diablo iii . <end> <start> updates for adobe's suite of programs and autocad should be coming soon as well . <end> <start> the new macbook_pro will feature intel's_3rd_-_generation_core_(_ivy_bridge_)_processor up to an i7_2_._7_ghz_quad_-_core , up to 768gb of internal_flash_storage , and up to 16gb of ram . <end> <start> kepler gt 650m graphics will also be included on all models of the new macbook pro , which should offer a superb gaming experience . <end> <start> the new macbook_pro will feature 7_hours of battery_life , with up_to_30_days of standby_time . <end> <start> completing the feature set are an sd reader , hdmi and usb 3 . 0 , magsafe 2 , thunderbolt , usb 3 . 0 , headphone jack , black magik 5k camera , firewire 800 , and gigaport ethernet thunderbolt adapters . <end> <start> the new macbook pro will start at $2 , 199 for the 2 . 3 ghz quad - core i7 model with 256gb flash storage , and go up from there . <end> <start> oh , and the best part ? <end> <start> the new macbook pro starts shipping today . <end> <start> go ahead and start throwing your credit cards at the screen , folks . <end>
<start> for me the new , unibody macbook_pro 17-inch ( pn mb604ll/a ) is probably the most exciting thing announced here at macworld_expo . <end> <start> not only because i 'm more of a hardware guy but also because i 'm a macbook freak . <end> <start> so , where to start ? <end> <start> the mbp has three compelling new features . <end> <start> the new mbp17 has a matte screen option . <end> <start> can i get a hallelujah ? ! <end> <start> i 've been a staunch critic of glossy displays in macbooks , and i 'm not the only one . <end> <start> it appears that cupertino is finally listening . <end> <start> the unibody macbook pro 17 is the first in the new form-factor macbooks to offer a configuration with a matte screen apple calls `` antiglare . '' <end> <start> it 's a $ 50 option though , which is a bit of a slap in the face . <end> <start> if i 'm spending $ 2,800 on a notebook computer you 'd think that apple would throw in the matte screen option . <end> <start> but at least it 's available , which is excellent . <end> <start> the question that remains is if the matte screen option will trickle down to the mbp15 and even the mb13 . <end> <start> representatives in the apple booth did n't know the answer when i asked them today . <end> <start> the new mbp17 can support up to 8gb of maximum ram ( and has 4gb standard ) which is a huge step in the right direction . <end> <start> if you can get past the 8gb $ 1,200 sticker price , that is . <end> <start> i 'm sure that the ram price is so high because the new 17 ships with two , 2gb 1066mhz ddr3 sdram modules and both have to be removed and replaced with two , 4gb modules to get to 8gb . <end> <start> prices will eventually come down and 8gb is an attractive option for memory hungry applications and anything to do with virtualization . <end> <start> the mbp17 's fixed battery is a bit of a scandal . <end> <start> it 's as if apple did n't learn its lesson with the macbook air and iphone batteries . <end> <start> after watching the video by the battery engineers during today 's keynote , i 'm partially convinced . <end> <start> their justification is that fixed batteries save a lot of room previously occupied by connectors , latches and doors . <end> <start> a fixed battery can use more internal real estate in the enclosure to store power - goes the refrain. as a result the mbp17 fixed battery holds 40 percent more energy and will last up to 8 hours on a charge ( 7 hours when using the faster nvidia 9600m gt chip ) according to apple . <end> <start> i 'm curious about the real-world run times though . <end> <start> most companies base their battery benchmarks on perfect world conditions and it will be interesting to see how long the new battery really lasts . <end> <start> the third usb port is a welcome addition but it comes at the expense of a dedicated fw400 port on the previous model . <end> <start> solid state drives ( ssds ) are now available as 128mb ( + $ 500 ) and 256mb ( + $ 900 ) options . <end> <start> in case you 're wondering , a maxed out mbp17 configuration ( 2.93ghz , 8gb , 256gb ssd and anti-glare ) will set you back $ 5,250 . <end> <start> start saving your nickels and dimes , kids . <end> <start> i 'm going to wait and see if the anti-glare screen trickles down to the mbp 15-inch before diving in , although the 8gb of ram is attractive . <end>

<start> south_sudan warns of war after sudan bombs refugee_camp <end> <start> military_aircraft from sudan crossed the_new_international_border_with_south_sudan and dropped bombs thursday in_and_around_a_camp filled with refugees , officials said . <end> <start> a government_official initially reported deaths , but an american activist who spoke to aid_workers at_the_camp later said there were no casualties . <end> <start> the violence in_and_near_the_yida_refugee_camp , located 10_miles_south_of_the_border , came one day after bombings were reported in_another_region_of_south_sudan , an attack that provoked strong condemnation from the u_._s_._state_department . <end> <start> the president of south sudan , which became the world's newest country only four months ago , said he fears the khartoum - based government intends to invade the south soon . <end> <start> "whatever allegations khartoum labels against the republic of south sudan are baseless , but intended to justify his pending invasion of the south , " president salva kiir said . <end> <start> he later added : "we are committed to peaceful resolutions to any conflict but we will never allow our sovereignty to be violated by anybody .

" <end> <start> mr . kiir has also accused the sudanese government of bombing the south sudanese area of guffa in recent days , killing at least seven people and potentially moving the insurgencies on both sides of the border closer to an international conflict . <end> <start> the united states issued a statement on thursday condemning "in the strongest possible terms" what it called "negative developments" between the nations , particularly the airstrike by the sudanese forces . <end> <start> "the provocative aerial bombardments near the border increase the potential of direct confrontation between sudan and south sudan , " the american statement said . <end> <start> sudan has denied striking south_sudanese_territory . <end> <start> nevertheless , on_thursday_afternoon an antonov_bomber dropped four_bombs on_the_south_sudanese_area_of_yida , hitting a_refugee_camp of roughly 21_,_000_people , some of them northern_sudanese who had crossed the border since the rebellion in_sudan began . <end> <start> according_to an aid_worker with knowledge of the event , two_bombs fell on_an_airstrip , one hit a school and one landed on_a_market , but did not detonate . <end> <start> there were varying reports of casualties , but none could be confirmed . <end> <start> while the two nations continue to discuss how to split lucrative oil revenues and the fate of the contested region of abyei , a spreading rebellion inside sudan has prompted the sudanese government to accuse the south of providing military support to the rebels . <end> <start> last week , the sudanese government lodged a formal complaint with the united nations security council , arguing that south sudan was trying to start a border war . <end> <start> "we don't have any intention to go to war again , but it is now up to the southern government to either strengthen its state without hostility , or to disturb us , " said a sudanese government spokesman , rabie a . atti . <end> <start> "if they come to war , they will lose a lot . " <end> <start> many residents in the sudanese provinces of southern kordofan and blue nile fought alongside the south during its civil war with the north . <end> <start> but the 2005 peace treaty placed the two provinces in sudan's territory , leaving south sudan to hold a referendum to decide its own fate . <end> <start> in january , the south sudanese voted almost unanimously to secede from the rest of the country . <end> <start> their fellow combatants in southern kordofan and blue nile remained on the other side of the border , and an armed rebellion soon began . <end> <start> "we are ready to fight and continue until we reach khartoum , " the sudanese capital , said one of the rebel leaders , abdel aziz al - hilu , in a september interview . <end> <start> "we are prepared for a protracted war , a long war , " he added , "in order to see this regime ousted .

" <end> <start> the violence is especially troubling given the history between the two sides : the black african tribes of south sudan and the mainly arab north battled two civil wars over more than five decades , and some 2 million died in the latest war , from 1983 - 2005 . <end> <start> a peace deal ended the war and south sudan became its own country in july after a successful independence referendum . <end> <start> but there have been lingering disputes over border demarcation and oil - sharing revenues . <end> <start> ryan_boyette , a former aid_worker who lives in_sudan who is now leading a team of 15_citizen_journalists , said he talked to five_aid_workers in_the_yida_camp , all of whom said that four_bombs were dropped but that they caused no casualties . <end> <start> boyette said a u_._n_._helicopter had landed on_a_nearby_airstrip right as the first_bomb hit . <end> <start> one of the bombs landed in_a_school_yard where about 300_students were attending class , but the bomb did not explode , boyette said , citing aid_workers at_the_camp . <end> <start> aleem siddique , a u . n . spokesman in south sudan , said : "we're concerned for the safety of civilians in the area following reports of explosions and we are liaising with the authorities . " <end> <start> jonathan hutson , a spokesman for the u . s . advocacy group the enough project , said aid workers inside the yida refugee camp said at least one bomb landed in the camp , and three or four fell outside it . <end> <start> the aid workers or their groups could not be named for security reasons , hutson said . <end> <start> hutson said at least 15_,_000_refugees who fled violence in_sudan are living in_the_yida_camp . <end> <start> they walked at least seven days to reach the camp , he said . <end> <start> miabek lang , the commissioner of pariang county in south sudan's unity state , said earlier that 12 people were killed and 20 were wounded in thursday's bombing . <end> <start> lang could not be reached again for clarification on the conflicting reports . <end> <start> the wednesday bombings in upper nile state sparked condemnation from the u . s . state department , which said the "unacceptable and unjustified" attacks increase the potential of conflict between sudan and south sudan . <end> <start> south sudan's president said thursday that seven people were killed in those bombings . <end> <start> john prendergast , the co - founder of the enough project , said the regime in khartoum , sudan's capital , is attempting to provoke south sudan into restarting a war . <end> <start> "the regime's end game is to either capture south sudan's oil fields along their common border , or achieve a stronger negotiating position on shared oil revenues and border demarcation , " prendergast said . <end> <start> "this provocation must be countered by the full force of the international community , or else a massive war could unfold . " <end> <start> south sudan's oil reserves must be pumped through pipelines that run through sudan . <end> <start> splitting the oil revenues has long been a major sticking point between the two sides . <end> <start> another major issue is the demarcation of the border . <end> <start> though the countries are now separate an official border has not yet been laid down . <end> <start> sudan has accused south sudan of arming pro - south sudan groups in its territory . <end> <start> but kiir said thursday that the accusations from khartoum are "smoke screens" to mask sudan's support of armed groups fighting a proxy war against south sudan . <end> <start> his comments came as sudan said an unspecified number of rebels , soldiers and civilians were killed in clashes in the border state of south kordofan in the town of talodi on thursday . <end> <start> sudanese army spokesman khaled saad , quoted in the official news agency suna , said the military had repelled a planned attack by forces loyal to the southern movement , or sudan people's liberation army , who hail from a minority ethnic group now in control of much of south sudan . <end>
<start> the un has disputed claims that hamas militants fired mortars from_the_gaza_school that has suffered the deadliest attack of the war with israel . <end> <start> three shells hit fakhura , a girls elementary school in_the_jabalya_refugee_camp_in_northern_gaza , at_about_3pm_on_tuesday_(_12am_yesterday_) , according_to un relief and works agency spokesman christopher_gunness . <end> <start> at least 43 people were killed and 55 wounded in the school , where hundreds of palestinians had sought refuge from the fighting , pushing the palestinian death toll above 680 since the conflict began on december 27 . <end> <start> two people were killed when an artillery shell hit a un school in the southern city of khan younis . <end> <start> three people also died in an air strike on another un school in gaza city 's shati refugee camp in the centre of the strip . <end> <start> the carnage appeared to intensify international efforts to arrange a ceasefire - just as deadly strikes on civilians in previous conflicts in lebanon raised pressure on israel to halt hostilities . <end> <start> israel moved quickly to explain the attack on the jabalya_school , saying its forces had been fired_on first . <end> <start> the casualties included hamas militants imad and hassan abu askar , both of whom had fired mortar shells at troops from the school , military officials said . <end> <start> however , john ging , the top un refugee official in gaza , said un staff and palestinian families in the school compound had been screened for weapons , and he disputed israel 's claim that mortars were fired from inside . <end> <start> `` as far as we are concerned , that is not true , but if israel has evidence of that they need to provide it to an independent inquiry , '' mr ging said . <end> <start> he added : `` there 's nowhere safe in gaza . <end> <start> everyone here is terrorised and traumatised . '' <end> <start> speaking after an initial investigation last night , mr gunness denied militants were at the school: <end> <start> `` we are 99.9 per cent sure that there were no militants or militant activities in the school and the school compound . '' <end> <start> mr gunness said earlier that schools were clearly marked with a un flag and that the gps co-ordinates of all un installations in gaza had been given some time ago to the israelis . <end> <start> he said unrwa wanted an impartial probe of the israeli shelling that could also determine whether militants had used the school for a mortar attack . <end> <start> mohammad awad , in hospital with shrapnel wounds to the legs and face , said he had come to the school with his family after his house was destroyed in the bombing of a neighbouring home of a hamas leader . <end> <start> he and other_men had been sitting in_the_schoolyard when shells hit the compound . <end> <start> `` i saw bodies flying and people torn to pieces , '' he said . <end> <start> umm ibrahim said she had lost an eight-year-old daughter and two sons , 11 and 14 . <end> <start> she had come to the school after a phone warning from the israelis that the family house would be struck because one son was a hamas militant . <end> <start> `` we escaped death in our house , but it pursued us to the school , '' she said . <end> <start> `` what can we do ? <end> <start> where should we go ? '' <end> <start> although israel said its return fire landed outside the school , witnesses described a series of blasts , which israeli officials said suggested militants had rigged the building with explosives . <end> <start> `` we face a very delicate situation where hamas is using the citizens of gaza as a protective vest , '' said military spokesman brigadier general avi benayahu . <end> <start> the incident renewed questions about israel 's ability to wage a precision war in densely populated gaza even as its forces pushed deeper into the narrow coastal territory . <end> <start> heavy clashes continued in the north yesterday and airstrikes across the densely populated coastal strip . <end> <start> an airstrike in the gaza city neighbourhood of zeitun , where much of the heavy fighting has taken place since ground forces invaded on saturday , left one armed militant dead and three wounded , medics said . <end> <start> clashes were continuing in zeitun , and there were reports of airstrikes on the southern cities of khan younis and rafah . <end> <start> one rocket made the deepest strike yet into israel - about 32km from tel aviv . <end>

" <end> <start> as we can now see , looking at the past month in hindsight , is that amd figured out that is needed to hunker down on its opteron processor roadmaps and not force server makers to absorb a socket change in 2012 , as was the original plan , but rather to get an improved "piledriver" core for opteron processors into the field this year and do lots of performance tuning to show what "bulldozer" class of chip can really do . <end> <start> the company then looked around and decided that it didn't need a new chip or chipset so much as a whole different set of technologies to sell to its server oem partners . <end> <start> that's where seamicro came in . <end> <start> much will be made of amd entering the server business with the acquisition of seamicro . <end> <start> but that's not the point , even if it will be technically true over the next months . <end> <start> lisa su , senior vice president and general manager of the new global business units at amd , who is tasked with making sure the company has the components from which server makers want to build systems , put the kibosh on that idea . <end> <start> "this is a technology play for us , " su explained , calling the interconnect used at the heart of the seamicro system a "unique technology" that would be a "building block" that amd integrates with its processors and chipsets and then in turn sells to server makers . <end> <start> the company will work now to get amd's opteron server processors embedded in the seamicro machines , which it expected to have accomplished by the second half of this year . <end> <start> the company will not divulge what opteron chips it will weld onto the seamicro server boards , but it stands to reason that it would be a low - voltage opteron 3200 or 4200 part . <end> <start> in an interview with el reg , mark papermaster , amd's cto , deflected all of the interesting questions about how the seamicro 3d torus interconnect might be used , such as extending it beyond one chassis to span multiple chassis under a single management and cluster domain , or maybe adding cache coherence and shared main memory across all or a portion of a seamicro server's nodes . <end> <start> the acquisition , said papermaster , "allows us to redefine the server building block , " and he noted that amd was keen on becoming "an agile soc company , " referring to system - on - chip designs that put processors and other system elements into a single piece of glass . <end> <start> and he confirmed el reg's sense that amd was not getting into the server business . <end> <start> "you have that exactly right , " said papermaster . <end> <start> when asked about when amd and seamicro started talking , papermaster would not be specific , except to say that amd "moved very , very rapidly . " <end> <start> this was quite possibly to keep someone else from buying seamicro and very certainly in part as a reaction to intel's purchase of the infiniband networking business from qlogic back in january for $125m . <end> <start> papermaster would not comment on rumors that amd has been taking a look at arm server chip maker calxeda , but it could very well turn out that if amd had tried to do that deal , it might be grateful that it fell through . <end> <start> the seamicro deal is a much better option if it wants to sell server interconnects and help oem customers build cloudy servers and maybe even clustered supercomputers based on the seamicro "freedom" fabric , as the latest generation is called . <end> <start> that fabric is processor and instruction set agnostic , as feldman has said many times , and seamicro only started out on atom processors because they gave the best bang for the watt . <end> <start> and it could turn out that calxeda and amd partner to make arm servers somewhere down the road . <end> <start> why not ? <end> <start> read wanted to make sure that everyone understood that the seamicro acquisition would have no effect on the company's 2012 and 2013 opteron processor roadmaps and system plans , and that amd was not leaving the traditional x86 server business . <end> <start> "we're in that business to stay , and we're going to grow it and invest in it , " read said . <end> <start> amd is paying $281m in cash and $53m in stock to acquire privately held seamicro , which raised $35m in two rounds of funding and also got $9 . 3m in funding from the us government as part of the $787bn american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) of 2009 . <end> <start> feldman is staying on at amd after the acquisition closes and will be general_manager of a new data_center_server_solutions_business_unit , reporting_to su . <end>
<start> both chipmakers are bullish about combining , but a key issue for them will be convincing skeptics they should join together in the first place <end> <start> advanced_micro_devices ( amd ) chief executive hector_ruiz waxed_metaphorical as he described his company 's acquisition of ati_technologies ( atyt ) . <end> <start> chipmaker amd , hoping to gain a_leg_up on a resurgent rival intel ( intc ) , on_july_24 ended months of speculation by saying it would buy graphics chipmaker ati for about_$_5.4_billion . <end> <start> `` we will move from being neighbors to being a family , '' ruiz told analysts on a conference call . <end> <start> the two companies have long partnered in the competitive market for chips that run personal computers and consumer electronics . <end> <start> but under the same roof , the companies will focus on innovations that are particularly attractive to corporate and mobile-computing customers , ruiz believes . <end> <start> the enlarged chipmaker will combine amd 's strength in fast-computing power with ati 's specialty in delivering detailed graphics onto a single , low-cost chip . <end> <start> but the problem with families-especially those formed by multibillion-dollar corporate mergers-is that they often end up dysfunctional . <end> <start> promised cost savings and sales increases do n't always pan out , and integration of disparate cultures and operations is frequently fraught with value-destroying rifts . <end> <start> maybe that 's why intel and nvidia ( nvda ) , the companies ' two_biggest_rivals , found a_lot to smile about on_july_24 , the day the deal was announced . <end> <start> `` i thought it was just impossible to get a gift like this , '' crowed nvidia ceo jen-hsun huang , in an interview with businessweek.com . <end> <start> ati is `` basically throwing in the towel , leaving us as the only stand-alone ( graphics chip ) company in the world . '' <end> <start> intel , the world 's largest graphics-chipmaker , declined to comment specifically on the deal . <end> <start> but company execs have noted intel continues to improve its own graphics chipsets and that it expects to deliver platforms of products , like centrino , that amd can not easily match . <end> <start> investors were n't too sure how happy the amd and ati family will turn out to be , either . <end> <start> amd shares fell almost 5 % on july 24 , to $ 17.40 , extending recent declines fueled by concern amd will be the biggest loser amid an escalating pc industry price war . <end> <start> `` the assumption of a significant amount of new debt and the need to address integration issues at a time when amd has been seeking to step up its competitive pressure in a fierce environment with intel is likely to weigh on amd 's share , '' lehman brothers semiconductor analyst tim luke noted in a report . <end> <start> indeed , amd and ati could be distracted from their core businesses for months as they combine into a company with $ 7.3 billion in annual sales and 15,000 employees sprawled through canada , california , and texas . <end> <start> credit-rating agency fitch_ratings lowered its outlook on amd 's debt to negative from positive on concern the chipmaker 's debt-to-capital_ratio will jump to 37_% from less_than_10_% because of a $_2.5_billion term loan it is using to partially finance the deal . <end> <start> the merger also could lock ati out of the business of supplying graphics_chipsets to intel-based_pcs , worth about_$_90_million a year in revenue . <end> <start> ati chipsets connect to intel 's processor through what 's known as a front side bus , which serves as a highway for transferring data . <end> <start> but amd , under a different licensing deal with intel , is not allowed to use that front side bus . <end> <start> `` we are evaluating the deal , and have got a lot to figure out how it would fit in with our existing agreements with both ati and amd , '' intel spokesman chuck mulloy says . <end> <start> and while ati and amd are busy ironing out their new relationship , intel and nvidia are rolling out some heavy-hitting chips of their own . <end> <start> intel and its pc partners on july 27 begin shipping for the first chips in a brand-new pc architecture called core 2 duo ( see businessweek.com , 7/24/06 , `` intel sharpens its offensive game '' ) . <end> <start> first up will be desktop chips , followed closely by new energy-sipping chips for notebook pcs . <end> <start> core 2 duo is expected to wrest the performance crown in the mainstream pc market from amd for the first time in more than two years . <end> <start> amd will not get a chance to grab it back until mid-2007 , when it is fully ramped on a new manufacturing process . <end> <start> meantime , nvidia is prepping to deliver a new high-end graphics chip later this year that company executives herald as the biggest leap forward in nearly a decade . <end> <start> after a high-profile delay in delivering a new chip in 2001 , nvidia has been steadily taking market share from ati in the lucrative market supplying screaming-fast graphic cards to the discriminating gaming community . <end> <start> amd says there 's plenty of reason to be bullish on the deal . <end> <start> the company has its sights on markets where nvidia and intel are not as strong . <end> <start> amd president dirk meyer hopes to use ati 's chipset business to develop an energy-sipping combo processing and graphics chip that can be paired with software partners to deliver a platform better able to compete with intel 's new vpro offering . <end> <start> intel has won early praise from software companies and large businesses for vpro , which bakes security and virtualization directly into the chip . <end> <start> with vpro , tech administrators managing thousands of pcs could partition parts of the system from workers-a feature that could keep viruses from rapidly spreading across corporate networks . <end> <start> and ati 's growing business of providing graphics chipsets to cell-phone makers nokia ( nok ) and motorola ( mot ) also will give it up a leg up over intel , he said . <end> <start> intel recently sold its cellular chip business to marvell technology ( mrvl ) for $ 600 million . <end> <start> `` customers want to get better mobile offerings and more stable commercial offerings , but they want to know that we 're still going to offer them the ability to choose , `` meyer says . <end> <start> even if relations between amd and nvidia turn frosty and ati loses intel 's business , amd executives predict a combined offering would bring in an additional $ 300 million in revenue in the pc realm alone for every share point gained against intel . <end> <start> still , not everyone 's sold. pip coburn , founder of tech advisory firm coburn ventures , notes amd has pinned its success on a range of variables . <end> <start> `` i do n't want six reasons , '' coburn says, <end> <start> `` i want two reasons , two good reasons . '' <end> <start> amd 's meyer says he knows the company has some heavy lifting ahead . <end> <start> `` the integration task is going to require focus , '' he says . <end> <start> the biggest job , however , may be convincing skeptics this family was worth forming in the first place . <end>
<start> amd announces strategic investment to accelerate cloud_server_strategy <end> <start> on_february_29_,_2012 , amd announced a definitive agreement to acquire seamicro , a pioneer in energy_-_efficient , high_-_bandwidth microservers . <end> <start> by acquiring seamicro , amd is accelerating our disruptive server strategy , taking advantage of an inflection point in the industry driving opportunities in low power , client mobility , emerging markets and the cloud_/_megadata_centers . <end> <start> this disruptive move positions amd to expand our current server offerings and provide our customers with low_-_power , low_-_cost , high_-_bandwidth platforms . <end> <start> with seamicro , amd builds upon our processor design and compute expertise with system_-_level advances in energy efficiency , total cost of ownership and density for customers . <end> <start> we are excited to have seamicro join amd . <end> <start> the combination of seamicro_ip with amd opteron™_technologies and our focus on execution provide amd differentiated capabilities to address the evolving needs of the server_market . <end>
<start> rbc_capital_markets downgraded ati_technologies to `` sector_perform '' from `` outperform '' after advanced_micro_devices announced its intention to buy the canadian graphics chip-maker for $_5.4_billion on monday . <end> <start> even though the takeover looks fairly valued , rbc analyst steve_arthur said there is limited upside to the offer unless competing bids are made for ati . <end> <start> for_now , arthur said amd 's takeover deal , which is expected to close in_the_fourth_quarter , effectively offers his one-year price_target of $_21 now . <end> <start> that price target was set prior to the takeover bid and factored in ati 's gross margin leverage , capital expenditure strength , a competitive product lineup and the launch of microsoft ( nasdaq : msft - news - people ) windows ' new operating system , vista , which would be a `` net positive '' for graphics-chips vendors . <end> <start> without a competitive bid to drive shares higher , ati is unlikely to outperform , warranting a `` sector perform '' rating in the analyst 's view . <end> <start> arthur said a competitive bid is possible but the two most-likely bidders , intel ( nasdaq : intc - news - people ) and nvdidia , face prohibitive anti-trust challenges. combined , ati and intel would have 68 % overall market share in pc graphics , while an ati-nvidia partnership would effectively capture 100 % of the discrete graphics market . <end> <start> other counteroffers could be made by texas instruments ( nyse : txn - news - people ) and broadcom ( nasdaq : brcm - news - people ) , which , according to arthur , would n't so much face anti-trust challenges as they would compatibility challenges . <end>

<start> amd enters server business with bold acquisition <end> <start> 02_._29_._12_4_:_15_pm <end> <start> chip_designer and chief intel rival amd has signed an agreement to acquire seamicro , a silicon_valley startup that seeks to save power and space by building servers from hundreds_of_low_-_power_processors . <end> <start> with the purchase , amd will not only turn itself into a server maker , it will turn itself into a server maker that uses chips from intel . <end> <start> today , seamicro ’ s servers are built with processors from amd ’ s rival , including intel ’ s atom_mobile_processors as well as intel xeon_chips . <end> <start> amd says it will continue to sell and support seamicro_servers equipped with intel_chips “ for the foreseeable future . ” <end> <start> but it also hopes to license seamicro ’ s server “ fabric ” technology to other server sellers , including big names dell and hp , and it plans to introduce amd opteron chips into seamicro machines sometime in the second half of the year . <end> <start> seamicro ’ s fabric is a way of efficiently connecting various pieces of server hardware , and the company says it can be used with virtually any processor . <end> <start> less than a month ago , intel and seamicro held a joint press event where they predicted a bright future together , so it would appear that the amd acquisition came about rather quickly . <end> <start> but amd ’ s lisa su — the company ’ s senior vice president and general manager for its global business units — says the chip designer has been eyeing technologies along the lines of seamicro ’ s for some time . <end> <start> “ we ’ ve been looking at the key technology innovations that are going to really disrupt the server market . <end> <start> we ’ ve been looking at fabric technologies — externally with a number of companies as well as internally , looking to develop ourselves — and we felt that seamicro was really the best option . <end> <start> it was proven , and it was in systems , ” su said on wednesday morning during a briefing with reporters . <end> <start> “ the complement of our processing capability and seamicro ’ s fabric technology gives us what we think is a very , very strong [ intellectual property ] portfolio . ” <end> <start> amd will pay $334_million for seamicro , including $281_million in cash . <end> <start> the deal is expected to close in “ a number of weeks . ” <end> <start> based in sunnyvale , california , seamicro is at the forefront of a movement to build servers from ultra - low - powered processors — aka “ wimpy cores . ” <end> <start> the idea is to reduce power by splitting applications into small pieces that can be spread across a larger number of chips , not unlike the one running your cell phone . <end> <start> texas startup calxeda offers “ wimpy core ” servers equipped with chips using the arm instruction set — an alternative to the x86 instruction set used by intel and amd — while hp is exploring the idea with a research effort it calls project moonshot . <end> <start> but last month , during that press event co - hosted by intel , seamicro announced that it would also offer servers equipped with intel xeon chips , which were specifically designed for servers . <end> <start> xeon consume more power , but they also offer more speed . <end> <start> seamicro says that certain software workloads are suited to the wimpy cores , while others are suited to “ brawny cores , ” and this same message is delivered by the likes of dave andersen , the carnegie melon professor who coined the wimpy core name . <end> <start> whatever processor it uses , seamicro says , it can save power and space when you compare its machines to traditional servers . <end> <start> the company has built specialized asic chip loaded with software that allows the company to build ultra - small motherboards that include little more than processors , memory , and the asic itself — and then connect hundreds of these boards . <end> <start> according to the company , this technology is “ chip agnostic , ” meaning it can relatively easily be used with new chip architectures . <end> <start> amd and seamicro say that they will “ explore ” the use of seamicro ’ s fabrics with all sorts of processors , both wimpy and brawny . <end> <start> this may include arm chips . <end> <start> in recent weeks , amd has hinted that it will eventually license arm technology . <end> <start> asked if the company will continue to offer ultra - low - power chips along the lines of the intel atom , seamicro ceo and co - founder andrew feldman said “ absolutely . ” <end> <start> but he declined to point to specific processor architectures . <end> <start> “ this [ seamicro fabric ] technology can work with larger cores and small cores . <end> <start> it can work with x86 and non -

on - a - chip ] , ” he said . <end> <start> “ it allows us to be more pushy in bringing in our ip . ” <end> <start> seamicro currently employs 80 people , and about half of them are engineers . <end> <start> one of those engineers is founder and chief technology officer gary lauterbach , who was previously an amd fellow and one of five architects who build the core of amd ’ s opteron processor . <end> <start> lauterbach was also a lead chip designer at sun microsystems , and the idea for seamicro first came to him when he and another sun executive got a look at the low - power servers that powered google ’ s search engine in the early part of the last decade . <end> <start> andrew_feldman will become the general_manager of amd ’ s new “ data_center_solutions_”_business . <end> <start> according to su , this business unit will continue to support the current “ roadmap ” for seamicro ’ s servers . <end> <start> this means that the company will sell and service seamicro ’ s intel atom and intel xeon systems — though su indicated that the company will eventually drop intel ’ s chips . <end> <start> she said that amd opteron chips will be added to seamicro system “ towards the end of this year . ” <end> <start> intel ’ s jason waxman — who heads the company ’ s general manager of intel ’ s high density computing group — tells wired that amd ’ s acquisition of seamicro “ doesn ’ t change a whole lot ” for intel . <end> <start> he says that amd will decide whether to keep selling seamicro servers with intel chips , and that intel will continue to reduce the power consumption of both its xeon and atom chips for use inside servers . <end> <start> “ being able to launch the seamicro product with intel xeon silicon was a good testimonial for us . <end> <start> they thought we were the best partner at the time , ” waxman said . <end> <start> “ they chose our silicon for a reason . ” <end> <start> whatever the fate of intel chips in seamicro servers , amd says the acquisition is about more than just selling machines . <end> <start> the idea is also to “ broaden ” amd ’ s relationships with server sellers such as dell and hp . <end> <start> presumably , this means that amd will license seamicro ’ s fabric technology to third - parties . <end> <start> “ we have new technology that we can add to our existing opteron roadmap to form something that can really differentiate us in the marketplace , ” su said . <end> <start> andrew feldman added that seamicro has already had discussions along these lines with the likes of dell and hp . <end> <start> currently , dell resells seamicro servers . <end> <start> that said , the acquisition means that — on some level — amd will be competing with its own customers . <end> <start> it will be both chip designer and server maker . <end> <start> but su downplayed this notion . <end> <start> “ we are not competing with our customers . <end> <start> we have to balance the fact that will continue to support [ seamicro's ] products . <end> <start> but the goal is to proliferate the technology with oems , ” su said , referring to original equipment manufacturers such as dell and hp . <end> <start> “ what we saw was a chance to take our technology to multiple markets , with multiple partners , in multiple geographies — in ways we couldn ’ t do on our own , ” said seamicro ceo and new amd general manager andrew feldman . <end> <start> “ the opportunity to collaborate with the oems was larger than the opportunity to compete with them . ” <end>
<start> advanced_micro_devices_inc. shook_up the personal computer_industry by buying ati_technologies_inc. for us_$_5.4-billion yesterday , opening_up a new front in the battle with intel_corp. to control the computer chip_market . <end> <start> the deal , which had been anticipated for_over_a_year , gives amd high-end graphics_technology and bolsters the company 's strategy to overtake intel as the dominant supplier of chips that power personal computers and other devices . <end> <start> as well , intel has been a buyer of ati 's graphic chips and that relationship looks to be in jeopardy . <end> <start> `` this reconfigures the market and puts amd in an amazingly new strong position , '' said jon peddie , an independent chip analyst in san francisco . <end>
<start> amd buys sea_micro for $334m to get_into energy - efficient “ microservers ” <end> <start> february_29_,_2012_2_:_27_pm <end> <start> there ’ s a sea change happening in a segment of the server market dubbed microservers . <end> <start> and sea_micro has been at the center of it , disrupting the market with energy efficient servers that use lightweight processors from intel . <end> <start> advanced_micro_devices is acquiring sea_micro today for $334_million , including $281_million in cash . <end> <start> sea micro has been disruptive because it can pack a lot of computing power in a server rack that is about a sixth of the usual size . <end> <start> its servers use a quarter of the usual electricity and cost a lot less . <end> <start> the servers use intel ’ s atom microprocessors , which are targeted at energy efficient devices such as tablet computers . <end> <start> but amd ’ s move could shake things up for intel , which presumably will lose some of its business . <end> <start> the advantage of sunnyvale_,_calif_._-_based seamicro ’ s small and power_-_efficient computers is that enterprises can now shove a lot more computing power into a given amount of space and use a lot less electrical power , thereby cutting electricity_bills dramatically . <end> <start> that matters because electricity costs are the biggest part of the budget for operating data centers . <end> <start> andrew feldman , chief executive of sea micro has said in past interviews that seamicro had become the fastest - growing system company in silicon valley history . <end> <start> seamicro ’ s customers include france telecom , skype , rogers wireless , mozilla , eharmony , and china netcom bb . <end> <start> hundreds of millions of internet users traverse seamicro ’ s hardware daily . <end> <start> as we ’ ve described in earlier stories , intel has been improving its server microprocessors by making them more power efficient . <end> <start> but the microprocessor only accounts for a third of the power consumption in a server . <end> <start> seamicro ’ s innovation lies in how it attacks the remaining two - thirds of the power consumption problem . <end> <start> it does so by combining a lot of the extraneous chips into a single , more - efficient custom chip , feldman said . <end> <start> in its earliest system , seamicro put 384 intel atom dual - core processors ( for a total of 64 - bit 768 cores ) in a 10 - rack system , which is just 17 . 5 inches high . <end> <start> the newer sm10000 - 64hd was a 20 percent improvement over seamicro ’ s previous server line and a 150 percent improvement on its compute density record , or the amount of computing power in a given space . <end> <start> that single machine could replace rival systems with a bunch of equipment : 60 traditional servers , four rack switches , four terminal servers , and a load balancing server . <end> <start> it uses a quarter of the power and a sixth of the space . <end> <start> seamicro can put an entire server on a motherboard that is 5 inches by 11 inches . <end> <start> since the hardware is intel - based , customers don ’ t have to change their software at all . <end> <start> seamicro was founded in 2007 and is backed with $60 million in funding by khosla ventures , draper fisher jurvetson , crosslink capital , and a number of strategic investors . <end> <start> it also won grants from the u . s . departement of energy ( $9 . 3 million ) and the state of california ( $250 , 000 ) . <end> <start> seamicro has 80 employees . <end> <start> most recently , it raised $20 million . <end> <start> seamicro also attacked the power consumption problem with a very clever trick known as virtualization . <end> <start> today , virtualization is frequently used with servers . <end> <start> it is a layer of software that rests between an application and the servers that it runs on . <end> <start> if an application needs only two servers , the virtualization software finds two available servers to run the application . <end> <start> if the application gets busy and needs 10 servers , the virtualization software finds 10 available servers to do the job . <end> <start> the application is no longer tied to specific servers ; the virtualization software frees up the overall system and gets more use out of the available servers . <end> <start> seamicro did the same thing , but it applied the concept of virtualization to the inside of a server . <end> <start> feldman designed custom chips that could take the tasks that were handled by everything beyond the intel microprocessor and its chip set . <end> <start> the custom chips virtualize all of those other components so that it finds the resource when it ’ s needed . <end> <start> it essentially tricks the microprocessor into thinking that the rest of the system is there when it needs it . <end> <start> seamicro virtualized a lot of functions that took up a lot of space inside each server in a rack . <end> <start> it also did the same with functions such as storage , networking , server management , and load balancing . <end> <start> full told , seamicro eliminates 90 percent of the components from a system board . <end> <start> seamicro calls this cpu / io virtualization . <end> <start> with it , seamicro shrinks the size of the system board from a pizza box to the size of a credit card . <end> <start> by boiling down the rest of the system into a couple of chips , seamicro can get rid of a lot of the components in a system , thereby getting rid of space , cost , and power consumption . <end>
<start> the buy should also expand amd 's manufacturing_capability , as well as integrate microprocessors and graphics_engines in a single chip . <end> <start> the acquisition is set to be wrapped up by year 's end . <end> <start> advanced_micro_devices ( nyse : amd ) announced the largest acquisition in its history monday , paying about_$_5.4_billion to acquire graphics chip specialist ati_technologies . <end> <start> the acquisition will let amd expand its position in the commercial_desktop and mobile_computing markets , two areas where the company has not had much success . <end> <start> in addition to accelerating the company 's x86 processor market share battle with intel ( nsdq : intc ) , the acquisition will expand amd 's access to manufacturing_capacity and will lead to products that will integrate both microprocessors and graphics_engines in a single chip in future releases . <end> <start> the startup manages large-scale web infrastructures to prevent downtime related to configuration changes march madness 2008 was carried in full on the internet , on demand thanks to the technology innovations of cbs sports and cbs interactive gm 's tech leader talks about consolidating , re-engineering , upgrading the company 's application infrastructure . <end> <start> `` together we intend to create a processing powerhouse , '' said hector_ruiz , chairman and chief executive of amd , during a teleconference to announce the deal . <end> <start> `` we are confident the companies will integrate well together . <end> <start> we believe that as technology advances , integration is not only inevitable , but also advantageous . '' <end> <start> beginning next year , the companies will market `` customer-centric platforms '' using amd and ati technologies that will include all existing product offerings . <end> <start> beginning in 2008 , amd plans to introduce platforms that integrate general purpose processors and graphics engines to meet specific media , data , and graphic requirements , says dave orton , president and chief executive of ati . <end> <start> bob rivet , cfo of amd , says the acquisition is expected to be completed by year 's end . <end> <start> the purchase is a combination of $_4.2_billion_in_cash and 57_million_shares of amd stock . <end> <start> amd 's current area of greatest strength is providing processors that address the server and consumer desktop market , rivet says . <end> <start> bringing ati 's graphics technology in-house will allow amd to better address the commercial desktop and laptop markets , he says , two areas where amd currently has a smaller presence . <end> <start> while overall sales of x86 processors currently totals about $ 30 billion annually , amd is primarily addressing only a segment that totals about $ 13 billion , rivet says . <end> <start> by expanding more into commercial desktop and laptop markets , amd will be able to grow its overall x86 market share . <end> <start> rivet says that each percentage of market share gained equates to about $ 300 million in revenue . <end> <start> ruiz says the acquisition `` opens_up a broad array of options for expanding our capacity_infrastructure '' by providing amd with an expanded relationship with some of the largest semiconductor_foundries in the world . <end> <start> currently amd utilizes internal manufacturing capacity , as well as capacity from chartered semiconductor manufacturing . <end> <start> ati , however , has manufacturing relationships with two of the other largest foundries in the world , taiwan semiconductor manufacturing and united microelectronics . <end> <start> the acquisition of ati by amd will now provide computer_makers and customers with another choice for integrated microprocessor and graphics_processor platforms , says bruce_shaw , director of worldwide commercial marketing for amd . <end> <start> currently only intel offers an integrated platform . <end> <start> although amd will be providing integrated platforms , it will continue to support the use of third-party graphics products , such as those from nvidia , in combination with its processors , shaw says . <end> <start> amd has no plans to reduce the ati product line or back away from markets it addresses , such as cell phones , where amd has little or no presence , he said . <end> <start> ati is expected to continue to operate out of its headquarters in markham , ontario , and layoffs are expected to be minimal . <end>
<start> amd buys seamicro , enters server_hardware business <end> <start> feb_29_,_2012_2_:_31_pm <end> <start> advanced_micro_devices announced wednesday it is buying low - power server vendor_seamicro , a surprise move that puts amd in the systems_business and disrupts intel by acquiring one of its close partners . <end> <start> amd will pay us$334_million in cash and stock for seamicro , an 80_-_employee silicon_valley startup that has gained attention for building highly dense and power_-_efficient servers for use in large_-_scale cloud computing_environments . <end> <start> seamicro ceo andrew_feldman will become general_manager of a new_division at amd , the data_center_server_solutions_group . <end> <start> amd plans to sell seamicro - branded servers directly to customers , but it bought the company primarily for its technology , which it hopes to license to other server vendors to build their own low_-_power systems , amd_officials said . <end> <start> "seamicro has a proven technology that has been benchmarked in key_customer_sites to show improvements in power consumption and total cost of ownership . <end> <start> that [ intellectual property ] was very attractive to us , " said lisa_su , senior vice president and general manager for amd's_products_division . <end> <start> the move will be seen as a setback to intel , which had built a tight partnership with seamicro . <end> <start> all the servers seamicro currently sells are based on low - power intel atom processors , and just a few weeks ago the companies held a joint press conference where intel sang seamicro's praises . <end> <start> an intel spokesman declined to comment on the acquisition wednesday before it was officially announced . <end> <start> amd will continue to sell seamicro servers based on intel processors "for the foreseeable future , " lu said . <end> <start> by the end of this year , she said , it will release the first seamicro servers based on amd opteron processors . <end> <start> feldman wouldn't say when seamicro and amd began talks but said the deal came about "unbelievably quickly . " <end> <start> he said there were other suitors for the company , including non - chip vendors . <end> <start> seamicro developed an interconnect technology that allows it to eliminate all but three of the chips on a standard server motherboard . <end> <start> that allowed it to develop servers that it claims consume one quarter the power and one sixth the space of standard x86 servers . <end> <start> its products are geared primarily towards high volume , web - based transaction workloads that don't require the computing muscle of a traditional xeon or opteron server processor . <end> <start> mozilla uses seamicro servers , for instance , to deliver software updates to users . <end> <start> it's not clear which amd processor seamicro will use as an alternative to intel's atom chip , though amd has several low - power offerings and plans to release a new , low - power chip for tablets , code named hondo , later this year . <end> <start> however , seamicro has said its technology can also benefit servers based on more powerful processors . <end> <start> a server based on an opteron chip would be efficient for running mysql and mondodb database workloads , feldman said , as well as php applications used by many online services . <end> <start> it could also be used to build efficient supercomputers , he said . <end> <start> it's a new direction for amd , one it hopes will allow it to expand its server business and capitalize on the fast - growing cloud computing market . <end> <start> spending on servers for such "scale out data centers" is expected to grow 33 percent a year on average for the next several years , amd said , faster than the server market as a whole . <end> <start> the move puts amd in the difficult position of competing with some of its customers , though lu insisted that will not be a problem . <end> <start> the scale of seamicro's business today is much smaller than that of a hewlett - packard or a dell , she said , and amd thinks the value of seamicro's technology to server vendors will outweigh their competitive concerns . <end> <start> amd's server business could use a lift , noted dean mccarron , principal analyst at mercury research . <end> <start> "they are obviously experiencing a decline and this would be a way to expand the market for their processors , " he said . <end> <start> amd is paying $281 million in cash for seamicro and the remainder in stock , lu said . <end> <start> it expects to close the deal in march . <end>

<start> amd's acquisition of seamicro puts intel on the defensive <end> <start> mar_2_,_2012_12_:_30_pm <end> <start> intel suffered a setback in the server market this_week with the news that its former partner , seamicro , is being acquired by amd . <end> <start> but the world's top chip maker said it was internally developing technology to remain competitive in the dense server market . <end> <start> intel is developing integrated fabrics to boost i / o and high - performance networking and storage in servers , said jason waxman , general manager of intel's data center business unit , in an interview . <end> <start> the technologies are being developed as the company tries to boost its presence in the market for dense servers used in cloud computing deployments in data centers . <end> <start> amd is paying us$334_million for seamicro , which until now was in a tight partnership with intel to develop dense_servers . <end> <start> amd plans to sell seamicro_-_branded_servers and license to customers its fabric_technology , which virtualizes i_/_o and ties together storage and networking . <end> <start> the deal is expected to close in march . <end> <start> seamicro provides amd an instant presence in the nascent but fast - growing dense server market , and intel will now be playing catch - up , analysts said . <end> <start> seamicro currently sells servers only with intel processors , and it is likely that amd will swap those with its own chips . <end> <start> intel said it will continue to provide processors for seamicro servers , depending on the requirements . <end> <start> amd's purchase of seamicro was an unexpected but smart move , said nathan brookwood , principal analyst at insight 64 . <end> <start> the dense server market is growing as companies look to curb electricity costs by deploying low - power servers to respond to web and database queries . <end> <start> but amd's prize in the acquisition is seamicro's specialized fabric , brookwood said . <end> <start> seamicro's dense servers have many credit - card - sized motherboards that are connected by the fabric , which reduces the need for extra storage and network controllers . <end> <start> it could take intel years to develop technology that is competitive with seamicro's fabric , brookwood said . <end> <start> and intel will need to prove its technology is reliable before it is widely adopted . <end> <start> "intel has all the pieces and all the technology and the smart people to put this together . <end> <start> but it takes time , " brookwood said . <end> <start> the seamicro deal gives amd a technological head start , but it will also intensify intel's focus on developing related technology , said dean mccarron , principal analyst at mercury research . <end> <start> intel's waxman didn't specify how intel would build the fabric and i / o technology , but said the company would utilize assets from recently acquired networking companies . <end> <start> in july it acquired fulcrum microsystems , which makes ethernet switches , and last month it purchased infiniband assets from qlogic , which provides high - performance fabric technology for servers . <end> <start> intel also will remain competitive through new processors , memory and system management technologies . <end> <start> but by the time intel's fabric technology matures , analysts said that amd could be far ahead in the integration of seamicro's technology inside chips . <end> <start> amd in the future will allow implementation of third - party intellectual property inside chips , and by 2013 or 2014 , seamicro's ip could be inside opteron server chips . <end> <start> currently seamicro's asic ( application - specific integrated circuit ) controlling the fabric is placed on the motherboard alongside the processor and memory . <end> <start> when integrated inside a chip , it could be similar to calxeda's energycore chip , which will be used by hewlett - packard in its upcoming arm server . <end> <start> the calxeda chip includes cache , an 80 - gigabit fabric switch and a management engine for power optimization . <end> <start> amd will be able to license the fabric technology to work on arm processors , which could also put pressure on intel , analysts said . <end> <start> arm processors are mainly found in smartphones and tablets , but there is growing interest in building power - efficient arm servers . <end> <start> amd will be able to differentiate its offerings from intel's by offering seamicro technology with either arm or x86 processors as early as 2013 , said matt eastwood , group vice president for enterprise platform research at idc . <end> <start> amd currently offers only x86 chips , but the company's chief technology officer , mark papermaster , has not ruled out implementing arm ip on its future chips . <end> <start> but intel's waxman said the amd - seamicro deal does not change intel's dense server strategy , and the chip maker will continue to work with customers like dell and tyan . <end> <start> "a part of our strategy is to provide a full portfolio of ingredients , " waxman said . <end> <start> "we've got the right assets in our arsenal .

<start> amd acquires seamicro – big bet on architectural shift for servers <end> <start> summary : rich fichera looks at the risks and potential rewards of amd's recent acquisition of innovative server startup seamicro . <end> <start> march_1_,_2012_-_-_07_:_58_gmt_(_23_:_58_pst ) <end> <start> at its recent financial analyst day , amd indicated that intended to differentiate itself by creating products that were advantaged in niche markets , with specific mention , among other segments , of servers , and to generally shake up the trench warfare that has had it on the losing side of its lifelong battle with intel ( my interpretation , not amd management ’ s words ) . <end> <start> today , at least for the server side of the business they made a move that can potentially offer them visibility and differentiation by acquiring innovative server startup seamicro . <end> <start> seamicro has attracted our attention since its appearance ( blog post 1 , blog post 2 ) , with its innovative architecture that dramatically reduces power and improves density by sharing components like i_/_o_adapters , disks and even bios over a proprietary fabric . <end> <start> the irony here is that seamicro came to market with a tight alignment with intel , who at one pint even introduced a special dual - core packaging of their atom cpu to allow seamicro improve its density and power efficiency . <end> <start> most recently seamicro and intel announced a new model which featured xeon cpus to address the more mainstream segments that were not a for seamicro ’ s original atom - based offering . <end> <start> so what does amd hope to gain from this acquisition ? <end> <start> the strategic goal is a differentiated server architecture into which they can insert amd silicon and ip . <end> <start> the seamicro architecture shares many of the characteristics of the calxeda / hp redstone architecture , and can potentially allow amd to produce reference architecture for its system partners to leverage that gives them significant density advantages over any conventional x86 server offering . <end> <start> since this architecture is initially targeted at dense computing environments such as those found in web 2 . 0 , cloud service providers and similar workloads , as well as potentially at conventional hpc , the prospects for amd are interesting . <end> <start> long - term success will hinge on several interlocking factors : <end> <start> 1 . how much will amd focus this offering on the ultra - dense space that seamicro started addressing versus trying to also take a bite out of the enterprise space ? <end> <start> 2 . how aggressively will they scale it ? <end> <start> the seamicro fabric does not extend beyond the single enclosure boundary , but that appears to be an implementation decision , not a fundamental architectural issue . <end> <start> my personal belief is that fabric - based servers are the wave of the future , with seamicro calxeda / hp serving as very significant guidelines for future development . <end> <start> scaling the fabric first for management and then for actual data traffic for shared i / o and eventually for coherent memory operations if needed is a natural progression . <end> <start> 3 . what other ip will amd add ? <end> <start> amd has an interesting portfolio of gpu technology as well as cpu , and the incorporation of gpu technology could provide further differentiation in niche markets . <end> <start> amd has a choice of ways to monetize this ip , from selling systems based on its own processors ( possibly as early as late this year ) to providing reference designs and / or licensing the architecture or selling components like the fabric asics . <end> <start> 4 . will they also support arm processors ? <end> <start> if amd becomes the source of licensed ip for vendors wanting to chase hp in ultra - dense servers , they can also make money by licensing their technology and selling components for non - x86 architectures . <end> <start> 5 . what will intel do ? <end> <start> at least one of intel ’ s partners , hp , already has a fabric - based dense server design that can support x86 . <end> <start> will intel develop a similar reference architecture in the hopes that their major systems partners will adopt it ? <end> <start> all in all , many ways this could play out , but a bold move and one that may serve to trigger a rapid change in the types of servers available to users over the next 24 months . <end>
<start> 3_/_27_/_2012_@_10_:_05am <end> <start> amd completes seamicro acquisition headed to $9 <end> <start> amd has completed its acquisition of seamicro as part of its strategy to regain lost server market share from intel and better position itself against future competition from arm_-_based_players such as nvidia . <end> <start> we previously wrote on how amd can benefit from this acquisition ( see amd picks up seamicro to strengthen server market offering ) . <end> <start> here we take a brief look at the price that amd paid for seamicro , and what this implies about its growth expectations . <end> <start> amd shelled_out $334_million for the acquisition of seamicro . <end> <start> since seamicro ’ s revenues or other financials were not disclosed , it becomes difficult to gauge whether the price paid was cheap or steep . <end> <start> however , based on certain assumptions , it is possible to understand the range of amd ’ s growth expectations from seamicro . <end> <start> for the purpose of calculations , we assume that seamicro operates at ebitda margin of close to 25% and apply similar corporate expenses ( as % of revenues ) including taxes , capital expenditures and others that we apply for amd . <end> <start> if we assume seamicro ’ s revenues for 2012 will be somewhere around $50 million , it implies that amd expects seamicro ’ s revenues to grow at an average annual rate of 43% to 44% over the course of our forecast period , which extends till 2018 . <end> <start> these revenues include both seamicro ’ s revenues as well as incremental benefit in server - related revenues from the acquisition . <end> <start> on the other hand , if we assume seamicro ’ s revenues for 2012 to be of the order of $150 million , it implies that amd ’ s growth expectation for seamicro and related incremental server revenues stands at somewhere around 16% to 17% . <end> <start> according to amd ’ s own calculations , it has paid a handsome price for the acquisition . <end> <start> our price estimate for amd stands at $9 . 21 , implying a premium of little under 15% to the market price . <end>

" <end> <start> after the courtroom emptied , crawford county deputy prosecuting attorney jacob howell and district 27 assistant district attorney anthony evans credited the verdict in the complicated and mostly circumstantial case to smart , attentive jurors . <end> <start> in closing_arguments on_the_sixth_day of simpson's trial , howell projected onto a video_screen a photo of 20 -

as - you - go phone . <end> <start> throughout the investigation and court proceedings , simpson repeatedly denied having bought such a phone despite a walmart video showing him doing so , then on wednesday he testified he bought it , but for clayton , not for himself , howell said . <end> <start> howell reminded the jury that flynn's roommate testified flynn left their apartment around 10 : 30 p . m . april 8 , a time matching the 10 : 30 p . m . call simpson's cousin's wife testified she saw him engaged in at her garage . <end> <start> howell reminded jurors that verizon wireless , cricket wireless and federal bureau of investigation cellular analysis experts testified about how the calls between the phone simpson purchased and flynn's phone pinged in cell towers covering the u . s . 271 corridor where simpson planned to spend the night with his cousins in fort smith and the rural mcginnis lane area between pocola and spiro where flynn's body was found . <end> <start> between 10 : 37 and 10 : 58 p . m . april 8 , the pay -

as - you - go phone , and two employees of the sac - n - pac near mcginnis lane testified they heard two to three gunshots around 11 p . m . <end> <start> howell contended simpson's whereabouts were not accounted for between 10 : 30 p . m . and 11 : 21 p . m . , when he made a purchase at an e - z mart near his cousins' home . <end> <start> and howell reminded jurors that simpson's cousins testified they became concerned about simpson's prolonged absence for the quick trip to the e - z mart and called him three times beginning at 11 p . m . <end> <start> those calls rolled to voice mail . <end> <start> in his closing statement , defense attorney warren gotcher of mcalester argued that the two sac - n - pac clerks stayed outside on their smoke break for 10 minutes after hearing the gunshots and never saw a car exit mcginnis lane . <end> <start> gotcher argued the timeline evidence showed simpson couldn't have been involved . <end> <start> he said area resident erica hawkins saw flynn's car in the roadway at 11 : 41 p . m . , and pulled around to shine her bright headlights on it . <end> <start> he reminded jurors that hawkins testified the driver's window was rolled down and she saw a red light inside the car , but she didn't see anyone in the car . <end> <start> gotcher suggested the light could have been from a phone charger found unattached on the seat next to flynn . <end> <start> gotcher said when deputy terry springwater arrived on the scene around 3 a . m . april 9 , the car window was rolled only three - fourths the way down , the parking lights were on , the trunk was unlatched and there was a body in the car . <end> <start> gotcher reminded jurors an oklahoma state bureau of investigation expert testified that flynn's body had not been moved after she was shot . <end> <start> "sometime between 11 : 41 p . m . and 3 a . m . , the window was rolled three - fourths the way down , parking lights turned on and trunk unlatched and maybe the phone charger disconnected , " gotcher contended . <end> <start> he contended , too , that clayton testified as the prosecution wished because he was afraid his parole would be revoked , and that simpson's cousins , likewise , testified as they had because they'd been threatened with a firearms charge and having their child taken away . <end> <start> evans contended simpson attempted character assassination of flynn and attempted to divert blame for her murder to others because "the defendant has the spotlight on him , and it's hot , and he needs to get it off him . <end> <start> so what does he do ? <end> <start> he pushes it over here . <end> <start> desperate men do desperate things . " <end> <start> evans contended simpson destroyed or manipulated evidence throughout the investigation . <end> <start> "i submit to you that beyond a reasonable doubt , the defendant is guilty of killing ka'loni flynn , and when he shot her , he also killed his own child , " evans said . <end>

'' <end> <start> this past offseason , the sixers bolstered their youthful , athletic roster with frontline cornerstone elton brand , who is leading the team in scoring ( 15.9 ) and rebounding ( 10.0 ) but is significantly short of his career scoring average and has already missed time this season due to injury . <end> <start> the expectations were high for a team that won 40 games and took detroit to six games in the eastern conference quarterfinal round last season . <end> <start> cheeks did not meet them . <end> <start> friday night 's 88-72 loss in cleveland , the team 's eighth in 10 games , was apparently the last straw. cheeks is the fifth nba head coach to be fired this season . <end> <start> `` i believe in this team . <end> <start> we are better than this , `` said stefanski . <end> <start> `` we are going to make it better . <end> <start> we will find a way to improve on this team. `` <end> <start> the member of the sixers ' 1982-83 nba championship team started his head coaching career in portland , where he finished with a 162-139 mark and a pair of playoff appearances . <end> <start> he guided a transition in philadelphia from the allen iverson era and won more games than expected last season behind a rising star , andre iguodala , a young frontcourt led by samuel dalembert and a veteran presence at point guard , andre miller . <end> <start> miller is averaging 15.5 points per game this season , but iguodala is averaging just 14.9 points per contest , a drop of five points per game from last season . <end> <start> dalembert is down almost five points per game ( 5.8 ppg ) and just over two rebounds ( 8.0 ) per contest . <end> <start> dileo is in his 19th season with the sixers basketball operations department . <end> <start> he spent four seasons as the team 's director of personnel ( 1999-2003 ) before being promoted to senior vp and assistant gm in september 2003 . <end>
<start> cheeks returns as sixers' fixer jim_o'brien was shown the door after a single tumultuous season . <end> <start> posted : may_24_,_2005 <end> <start> billy_king spun the 76ers' head coach revolving door again yesterday , pushing_out jim_o'brien after just one season and bringing_in maurice_cheeks , the popular former sixers player and assistant coach , as o'brien's replacement . <end> <start> nearly_three_weeks_after the sixers ended their season , king decided to fire o'brien , who still has two_years and $8_million left on the contract he signed when he was hired by the sixers on_april_21_,_2004 . <end> <start> cheeks , who was fired march 2 as head coach of the portland trail blazers , is the fourth head coach since king took over as the team's president and general manager on may 26 , 2003 . <end> <start> that is the same date that larry brown resigned from the sixers after six seasons , the last time coaching stability existed with the team . <end> <start> cheeks was a second - round draft choice of the 76ers in 1978 and played for 11 seasons with the team . <end> <start> he was the point guard and floor leader of the sixers' 1983 nba title team . <end> <start> at a news conference last night at the philadelphia college of osteopathic medicine , king said he had the support of ed snider , the chairman of comcast - spectacor , the team's owner , for his latest moves even though the sixers will be paying ex - coaches randy ayers ( $2 million ) and o'brien along with cheeks next season . <end> <start> "in talking with ed , we felt the main focus was that we want to make the right decisions and not let money be the factor , " king said . <end> <start> "we think we owe it to our fans and the city of philadelphia to do that . " <end> <start> cheeks , 48 , a four - time nba all - star while with the sixers , was fired from the blazers , his first head coaching job , in the middle of his fourth season . <end> <start> he led the team to a 162 - 139 record . <end> <start> two years ago , after brown resigned , king looked to cheeks to take over as brown's successor . <end> <start> but the trail blazers rebuffed him three times , because cheeks was still under contract to them . <end> <start> the sixers then hired ayers , who lasted 52 games before being replaced by chris ford . <end> <start> king said he decided on_saturday to fire o'brien , and then checked with cheeks to see if he'd be interested in the job . <end> <start> cheeks said he would be , and king called him again yesterday and reached a deal after notifying o'brien of his decision . <end> <start> terms of the deal were not disclosed . <end> <start> when king hired o'brien , he had called him a "perfect fit" for the job . <end> <start> o'brien did lead the sixers to a 43 - 39 record - a 10 - win improvement over the previous season - and a playoff berth and coached allen iverson to his fourth nba scoring title . <end> <start> but in evaluating the season , king said he didn't think the sixers were heading in the right direction . <end> <start> he had a problem with the team's style of play , which included reliance on the three - point basket and a defense that protected the paint but had trouble getting out on perimeter shooters . <end> <start> there was also talk that o'brien was aloof and not communicative with his players . <end> <start> he did not start samuel dalembert , a developing young center , until the season's 19th game , and he did not play willie green with iverson for much of the season's final four months because he felt that was a bad matchup defensively . <end> <start> king said that in his postseason meetings with players , "not one of them said they wouldn't play for jim . . . <end> <start> that they'd all come back ready to go and try to go further in the playoffs . " <end> <start> but other things bothered him . <end> <start> king said he didn't want to make a snap decision when the season ended on may 3 , the day that the detroit pistons eliminated the sixers from the playoffs . <end> <start> he talked to his management team , went on vacation for a week , then made his decision on saturday . <end> <start> "in the interview process with jim , there were a lot of things that we talked about , " king said . <end> <start> "but in watching the season , evaluating our young players' development and evaluating our style of play , it wasn't something i was comfortable with . " <end> <start> reached by telephone yesterday , o'brien declined to comment . <end> <start> "i'm not going to have any discussion about this , " he said . <end> <start> king said that when he broke the news yesterday to o'brien , "he asked why , and i told him that i just felt there were some things that took_place that i don't think will change and we're going to make a change . <end> <start> he said , 'thank you . ' " <end> <start> snider , who attended king's news conference , said he backed king . <end> <start> "i really don't question billy at all , " he said . <end> <start> "i know what went on in the process when he made this decision , as well as the decision to hire jim o'brien . <end> <start> i've supported his moves , and i still do .

" <end> <start> he is still the franchise's all - time leader in assists and steals . <end> <start> cheeks also played with san antonio , new york , atlanta and new jersey before retiring in 1993 . <end> <start> cheeks returned to the sixers in 1994 as an assistant coach and stayed for seven seasons until the trail blazers hired him as head coach on june 27 , 2001 . <end> <start> under cheeks' guidance , the blazers made the playoffs in 2002 and 2003 , but did not get out of the first round . <end> <start> they missed the postseason in 2004 , breaking a streak of 21 consecutive years in the playoffs , and were wracked by dissension . <end> <start> "i look at mo cheeks and i know mo cheeks , " king said . <end> <start> "if players have problems with mo cheeks , then there's got to be something wrong with those players . " <end> <start> under o'brien , the former head coach of the boston celtics , iverson moved from shooting guard to point guard and responded with an mvp - caliber season , winning his fourth nba scoring title . <end> <start> but o'brien is gone now . <end> <start> cheeks is in . <end> <start> and king knows he's being held accountable . <end> <start> "i look in the mirror every day , " king said . <end> <start> "i'm not somebody that's above scrutiny , but i think i try to do the best i can and make the best decisions .

<start> maurice_cheeks was fired saturday as coach of the_philadelphia_76ers , who are slumping at 9-14 a_year after making the playoffs . <end> <start> assistant general manager tony dileo was appointed coach for rest of the season . <end> <start> the dismissal came hours before the 76ers were to play at home , with dileo making his coaching debut against washington . <end> <start> team president ed stefanski said he met with cheeks , describing the former 76er star as a `` gentleman throughout '' and a `` class act .

'' <end> <start> cheeks was one of more the popular players in 76ers history and was starting his fourth season as coach. stefanski had given cheeks two contract extensions in the past season , but the slow start was enough to cost him his job . <end> <start> cheeks became the fifth nba coach fired this season following p.j. carlesimo ( oklahoma city ) , eddie jordan ( washington ) , sam mitchell ( toronto ) and randy wittman ( minnesota ) . <end> <start> a message left on cheeks ' cell phone was not immediately returned . <end> <start> dileo has spent 19 seasons with the 76ers . <end> <start> he was promoted to senior vice president/assistant general manager in 2003 . <end> <start> his son , t.j. dileo , is a guard for temple and he said after the owls ' 88-72 win over no. 8 tennessee that he was excited his father had a chance to coach . <end> <start> `` i think it 's unfortunate for mo , he 's a great coach , but my dad is ready to step in , `` dileo said . <end> <start> `` this caught us by surprise . <end> <start> we had no idea . '' <end> <start> dileo said he had n't talked to his father yet , but noticed one missed call from him on his cell phone . <end> <start> cheeks led the 76ers to the playoffs last year for the first time while he was coach . <end> <start> philadelphia was one of the surprise teams in the east last season , and the 76ers anticipated a deep run in the playoffs this year . <end> <start> they signed elton brand to a five-year deal worth nearly $ 80 million last summer , but they have struggled with him in the lineup and have lost eight of 10 . <end> <start> last season , the 76ers lost in the first round to detroit . <end> <start> after an 18-30 start , philadelphia won 18 of its next 23 games and wound up at 40-42 , the sixth seed in the eastern conference . <end> <start> stefanski rewarded cheeks with two contract extensions in seven months that would have taken him to the end of next season . <end> <start> instead , with the team on a three-game losing streak and last in the atlantic division , he did n't even last until the end of the calendar year . <end> <start> cheeks also coached at portland . <end> <start> he played 15 seasons in the nba , the first 11 with philadelphia , and retired in 1993 . <end> <start> an outstanding defensive player , cheeks played in four all-star games and was a member of the 76ers ' championship team in 1982-83 . <end> <start> his no. 10 jersey hangs in the rafters . <end>

" <end> <start> cheeks was one of the most popular 76ers from 1978 - 89 and played on philadelphia's last championship team in 1983 . <end> <start> he also spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the 76ers , was part of the staff under brown when they went to the nba finals in 2001 and developed a strong bond with allen iverson . <end> <start> cheeks was fired march 2 after nearly four seasons as coach of the trail blazers . <end> <start> he had a 162 - 139 record in portland , the fourth - highest win total in blazers history . <end> <start> cheeks guided the team to the playoffs his first two seasons , but the players hardly made cheeks' tenure easy - - on or off the court . <end> <start> the team was nicknamed the "jail blazers" after several brushes with the law , many of them involving marijuana possession . <end> <start> "if players have problems with mo cheeks . . . then there's got to be something wrong with those players , " king said . <end> <start> but cheeks' return to the city where he was a four_-_time all_-_star shouldn't come as a surprise . <end> <start> the trail blazers turned down philadelphia's request to speak to cheeks as a possible replacement for brown , but the former point guard always remained popular with philly fans and was at the top of the sixers' short list to take over for ford . <end> <start> now , they'll get their wish . <end> <start> "we do not want to change coaches [ again ] , " sixers chairman ed snider said . <end> <start> "we've seen enough coaches . " <end> <start> the sixers will pay ayers , o'brien and cheeks next season . <end> <start> "i don't think it's something we're very proud of , but i don't think it reflects poorly , " snider said . <end> <start> o'brien is the son - in - law of hall of fame coach jack ramsay . <end> <start> he led the sixers to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they returned to the playoffs , largely on the back of a healthy , happy iverson . <end> <start> while o'brien avoided public spats with iverson , he did not have the full support of the rest of the team . <end> <start> some of the younger players , like samuel dalembert and willie green , felt they did not develop like they should have under o'brien and were unsure about their roles . <end> <start> "in looking at the development of some of them , yeah , i wasn't pleased , " king said . <end> <start> the sixers also failed to really understand o'brien's defense , a sticking point even in the postseason . <end> <start> "some of the criteria on our defense wasn't there , " king said . <end> <start> cheeks , who once famously came to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forgot the words to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hopes to bail out his former team and bring them another championship . <end> <start> "mo has played this game here in philadelphia , won a championship here in philadelphia , understands players , understands defenses , understands the way i think we want to play , " king said . <end>
<start> philadelphia 76ers president and general manager ed_stefanski announced that the team has relieved maurice_cheeks of his head coaching responsibilities . <end> <start> cheeks will be replaced on an interim basis by sixers senior vice president and assistant general manager tony dileo , who will remain in the position through the end of the 2008-09 season . <end> <start> `` decisions of this nature are never easy , and this was particularly difficult due to the great amount of respect i have for maurice cheeks , '' stefanski said . <end> <start> `` however , at this time i felt that it is in the best interest of this team to make a change while there is still time to accomplish the goals we set forth for ourselves at the start of the season . <end> <start> `` tony dileo has a wealth of basketball knowledge and coaching experience - both in the nba and on the international level - and is familiar not only with our current group of players but the style of play we are striving to attain on a consistent basis . '' <end> <start> dileo is in his 19th season with the sixers organization and was in his fifth as the team 's senior vice president and assistant general manager . <end> <start> during his tenure with the sixers , dileo has been involved in every aspect of the team 's basketball operations . <end> <start> in his role as senior vice president and assistant general manager , dileo was responsible for assisting stefanski with player procurement via his evaluation of amateur and professional talent while supervising the team 's draft efforts and overseeing the college and professional scouting systems . <end> <start> prior to that , dileo spent four seasons as the sixers director of player personnel ( 1999-2003 ) and has served as an assistant coach under larry brown , jim lynam , fred carter , john lucas and doug moe . <end> <start> dileo has extensive experience in international basketball as both a player and a coach . <end> <start> he coached the former west german men 's and women 's teams from 1979-90 , winning nine national titles in that country 's top division , earning coach of the year honors in 1987 . <end> <start> additionally , he was selected as the west german federation national coach from 1981-85 and during that time , wrote and published the european basketball handbook , a guide designed to acclimate american players overseas . <end> <start> a star at cinnaminson ( n.j. ) high school , dileo went on to play at tennessee tech and lasalle university , where as a junior he was named first-team academic all-american and went on to graduate maxima cum laude from the lasalle school of business . <end> <start> cheeks was named the 21st head coach in team history on may 23 , 2005 . <end> <start> in just over three seasons at the helm for philadelphia , cheeks compiled a mark of 122-147 ( .454 ) . <end> <start> last season , cheeks guided the sixers to the nba playoffs for the first time since the 2004-05 season , after starting the year with an 18-30 record . <end> <start> the sixers went on to win 18 of their next 23 games , becoming just the sixth team in nba history to go over .500 after being at least 12 games below .500 at some point during the same season . <end> <start> in 2006-07 , cheeks helped rally the sixers from a 5-19 start to make a push for the playoffs with a 35-47 record . <end> <start> philadelphia increased their winning percentage to .519 in games played after january 1 , compared to a winning percentage of just .267 during the first two months of the year - the biggest improvement by any team in the league during that span . <end> <start> the sixers also tied for the eighth best winning percentage after the all-star break ( 18-11 ; .621 ) . <end> <start> in his first season as head coach of the sixers , cheeks guided the team to a 38-44 mark and fell just two wins shy of reaching the post-season . <end> <start> on april 18 of that year , he earned the 200th win of his coaching career . <end> <start> cheeks record as an nba head coach with both portland and philadelphia stands at 284-286 ( .498 ) . <end>
<start> philadelphia_76ers fired jim_o'brien , coach . named maurice_cheeks coach . <end>
<start> not because mo cheeks was long for the job with the philadelphia 76ers . <end> <start> like all coaches not in the upper stratosphere of the coaching hierarchy -- your phil jacksons and gregg popoviches -- he was only as good as his last 10-game stretch , only as secure as how well his star was playing . <end> <start> but the_76ers , while underachieving at 9-14 when cheeks was fired saturday_morning , were not an embarassment when they went on_the_court , not a disjointed bunch that clearly was no longer listening to or playing for its coach . <end> <start> this was n't p.j. carlesimo ( oklahoma city ) or eddie jordan ( washington ) , whose team 's putrid won-loss records sank any chance they had of survival . <end> <start> this was n't sam mitchell ( toronto ) , whose differences of opinion with his general manager about his team 's personnel were too big to overcome . <end> <start> this was n't randy wittman ( minnesota ) , whose fan base was staying away in droves as the paying public grew indifferent to the on-court product . <end> <start> the timing of this move by team president and general manager ed stefanski was a head-scratcher . <end> <start> `` it 's not 100 percent on the coach , '' a source with knowledge of the 76ers ' thinking said saturday afternoon . <end> <start> `` but at the same time , we did n't seem to have a plan . '' <end> <start> stefanski named assistant general manager tony dileo coach for the rest of the season . <end> <start> dileo has a good reputation as a coach , spending time over the last two decades on the sixers ' bench as an assistant and in europe as a head coach . <end> <start> but unless circumstances change dramatically , jordan -- who became close with stefanski while both were in new jersey earlier this decade -- will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly . <end> <start> many league execs still think quite highly of jordan , and none of the players who matter in washington threw jordan under the bus after he was fired . <end> <start> cheeks ' coaching moves have frequently been criticized over the years , both in philadelphia and in portland . <end> <start> but he lost his job this time not only because of xs and os , but because so many of the 76ers ' players that blossomed under him last season , including center sam dalembert , forward andre iguodala and guard lou williams , struggled to get going this season . <end> <start> and the moves cheeks made , like benching second-year forward thaddeus young and elevating guard willie green , have n't produced enough dividends . <end> <start> `` ed just was n't seeing any progress , '' the source said , and stefanski expected more from a team that had signed free agent elton brand to an $ 82 million deal and re-signed core players iguodala and williams for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively . <end> <start> `` we were n't progressing at the rate [ stefanski ] thought we should , and he thought it was time for a move , '' the source said . <end> <start> yet stefanski can not escape criticism , either . <end> <start> bringing brand in was the signing coup of the nba offseason , to be sure . <end> <start> but in doing that , stefanski changed the team 's footprint . <end> <start> the sixers are still a very good transition team . <end> <start> but when the game slows down , having to cater to brand leaves the lane clogged . <end> <start> last season , iguodala , young and williams had driving room when philly ran its halfcourt sets , and dalembert showed occasional decent low-post play . <end> <start> but now , brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter . <end> <start> left to fend for himself on the weakside , dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and williams has just begun to play well . <end> <start> brand is recovered from the achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular . <end> <start> no matter what the stats say , philly looks and plays slower this season . <end> <start> and stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of brand inside . <end> <start> veterans donyell marshall and kareem rush , signed later in the summer by philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams . <end> <start> the result is philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only charlotte and oklahoma city have scored 100 points fewer times than philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league . <end> <start> `` everybody zones them , '' an eastern conference executive said saturday . <end> <start> the sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at detroit . <end> <start> true , they had bad losses early to the bobcats and timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the cavaliers on wednesday and friday . <end> <start> but last we checked , cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season . <end> <start> the cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment . <end> <start> another league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said saturday that the cleveland losses played no role in cheeks 's firing . <end> <start> cheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last september , taking him through the 2009-10 season . <end> <start> while stefanski did n't hire cheeks ( that was former president billy king , whom stefanski replaced early last season ) , stefanski and cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another . <end> <start> cheeks quickly acquiesced last year when stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting young and young vets rodney carney and williams bigger minutes . <end> <start> the transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition . <end> <start> they rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round . <end> <start> they were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that brand was stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been king 's ultimate target . <end> <start> after a brief dalliance with atlanta free agent josh smith , so stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending carney and center calvin booth to minnesota , and then struck , getting brand to spurn his former team , the clippers , as well as the warriors , for the sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the `` philly max , '' as brand later called it . <end> <start> after

<start> the hunger games director gary_ross still in negotiations for the sequel <end> <start> published : 2012_-_04_-_04_11_:_47_:_35 <end> <start> during the promotional period for the hunger games everyone involved made sure to note how different the franchise was from twilight . <end> <start> while it may have seemed like a silly thing to do given twilight's success , but the truth is that comparisons were making male audiences a bit shaky about the film , as that demographic didn't want to spend two and a half hours watching a tween romance ( and hunger games is definitely not that ) . <end> <start> the film obviously wasn't hurt by this strategy , as it went on to shatter records and become the third highest grossing opening weekend title of all time . <end> <start> but while the story of the hunger games may have no comparison to twilight , it turns out that action behind the scenes may duplicate it . <end> <start> while the first movie was a huge success , thr is saying that director gary_ross is still in negotiations to direct the sequel , catching_fire . <end> <start> the stars of the film - the ones that survived , anyway - are already contractually obligated to appear in the second movie , but things haven't been going to great on the filmmaker side . <end> <start> the trade says that ross' negotiations with lionsgate the_first time around weren't so hot either , an inside source calling it "a terrible experience , " as the studio doesn't usually pay "seasoned - filmmaker fees" to even seasoned filmmakers like ross . ? <end> <start> because of the_hunger_games' big box_office numbers , ross is expecting a raise for his work on the movie ( he was given $3_million upfront and 5% on the backend with his first deal ) but it's unclear if the studio will give it to him . <end> <start> much like the twilight franchise , or even harry_potter , it's entirely possible that lionsgate will choose not to pay ross and instead go with another filmmaker who is demanding less money . <end> <start> a script has already been written for catching fire , from simon beaufoy , but ross has not yet had the chance to revise it . <end> <start> the one big card that ross has in his back pocket is that the hunger games was better received than any of the twilight films , which could convince the brass to try and keep some consistency . <end> <start> whether it will play in his favor is still an unknown at this point . <end> <start> so what do you think ? <end> <start> should ross be brought back for the next movie or should they go with someone else's vision ? <end> <start> leave your thoughts , ideas and desires in the comments section below . <end>

<start> gary_ross remains in negotiations to direct 'the_hunger_games' sequel <end> <start> wednesday_,_04_april_2012_10_:_30 <end> <start> after opening to the third - biggest domestic debut weekend of all time , legitimate pop culture phenomenon the hunger games has grossed $368 . 0 million globally . <end> <start> it's done so in under two weeks of theatrical release . <end> <start> so with by far the biggest hit in its history , lionsgate is naturally keen to continue the series with catching fire , the already announced adaptation of suzanne collins's novel . <end> <start> but apparently it's not a guarantee that gary_ross , who co_-_wrote and directed the_hunger_games , will be back for another round . <end> <start> lionsgate has long been open about its intent to turn collins's bestselling young adult novels into a franchise , one that would spin four movies out of the literary trilogy . <end> <start> last year , the studio staked out a november 22 , 2013 release date for catching fire and pursued oscar winning slumdog millionaire screenwriter simon beaufoy to pen the script . <end> <start> in january , word emerged that beaufoy was indeed at work on catching fire , and at the time , word was that he was doing so under ross's supervision , with the director set to return . <end> <start> since then , it's been generally accepted that ross would take another trip to panem , particularly once the hunger games received an overwhelmingly positive critical response and , you know , made dump trucks of money . <end> <start> ross has by no means been set to direct , however . <end> <start> according to the_hollywood_reporter , he has yet to formally sign_on , and negotiations might just be proceeding with some difficulty , if the process on the_hunger_games is any indicator . <end> <start> the reports cites an anonymous source familiar with ross's negotiations last time , who cites it as , "a terrible experience . " <end> <start> lionsgate , unaccustomed to dealing with directors as established as the four time oscar nominee and pleasantville and seabiscuit director , reportedly played some hardball with ross , who ended up being paid $3 million . <end> <start> that relatively low figure was no doubt helped by the 5% of the film's backend profits . <end> <start> having delivered a critically acclaimed , zeitgeist - tapping event movie , ross is doubtless expecting a bigger figure for catching_fire , but will lionsgate pay it ? <end> <start> probably . <end> <start> but maybe not . <end> <start> lionsgate recently bought summit entertainment , the distributor behind the twilight franchise , meaning that the lionsgate film division is now under the auspices of summit's patrick wachsberger and rob friedman . <end> <start> the revolving door of directors on the twilight series has some fans worried that a similar policy might be carried out with the hunger games sequels . <end> <start> negotiations with ross didn't actually begin until roughly three weeks before the first film's release , at which point it was obvious that the film would be successful , giving no small amount of leverage to the director , who co - wrote the screenplay with collins and billy ray . <end> <start> while ross wasn't signed on to multiple films , stars jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth are all on board for the duration of the series . <end> <start> but that's not say there's no potential issues there either . <end> <start> the unanimously - praised lawrence is also contractually obligated to reprise her role as mystique in a sequel to last year's x - men : first class . <end> <start> her commitment there apparently supersedes her hunger games contract , meaning that if fox goes ahead with another x - men at an inconvenient moment , it could complicate the catching fire schedule . <end> <start> of course , all of this could be conjecture or , at the very least , over - analysis . <end> <start> let's not get hysterical just yet , folks . <end>
<start> the last five days have been a wild rollercoaster ride for `` twilight '' fans , as the film 's director was told her services would no longer be required for the sequels , fueling speculation over her replacement , followed by a rumor about a supposed successor . <end> <start> now , it seems , a battle is going on between a studio saying there 's no news to report and an entertainment magazine claiming chris_weitz is getting behind the `` twilight '' steering wheel . <end> <start> `` there will be a new director atop the 'twilight ' franchise : and he 'll be a man , '' entertainment weekly 's `` hollywood insider '' is reporting . <end> <start> `` sources tell ew.com that summit entertainment is about to hire chris weitz ( 'the golden compass ' ) as the shepherd for 'new moon , ' the second installment of stephenie meyer 's best-selling 'twilight ' series .

'' <end> <start> `` we are not confirming , '' echoed a second representative . <end> <start> whether ew is hearing incorrectly from their sources or the studio is just biding time until it can make a proper announcement , this much seems certain : catherine hardwicke is moving on to future projects that will not involve teenage vampires , and a man is likely to take her place . <end> <start> twilighters have spent much of the week arguing with each other - and attempting to form protests and letter-writing campaigns - while debating whether they should speak out against the changes to their beloved franchise . <end> <start> whether they 'll warm to weitz is anyone 's guess , but at least the filmmaker can always take solace in the fact that the fanbase similarly rebelled against kristen stewart and robert pattinson when they originally signed up for the film that would make them superstars . <end>

<start> the major heavyweight year ended much as it started , with wladimir klitschko owning the division against overmatched opposition , and with hasim rahman being nothing but a shell of the man that once shockingly knocked out lennox lewis . <end> <start> klitschko dominated rahman over six-plus rounds , knocking him down in a horribly one-sided sixth round and then landing enough hard blows early_in_the_seventh for referee tony_weeks to step_in and call an end to it . <end> <start> that should just about do it for the 36-year old rahman , who has n't scored an impressive or notable win since 2005 . <end> <start> since that win over monte barrett , rahman has gone 4-2-1 with a no-contest , beating nothing but club fighters , and often not even looking good doing that . <end> <start> he 's had a long , strange career , and it looks like it 's over at the top tier . <end> <start> he was so thoroughly overmatched tonight and unwilling to fight klitschko that he 's clearly got nothing left as a top fighter . <end> <start> klitschko will move on and fight alexander povetkin , chris arreola or david haye sometime in march or april , i 'd wager , and he should be a heavy , heavy favorite against any of them . <end> <start> arreola was hurt by travis walker , povetkin just does n't strike me as capable of being a truly top-notch guy , and haye was shaken by monte barrett a bit even though he did basically dominate . <end> <start> i 'd love to see klitschko-haye simply because i think haye will make wlad work . <end> <start> i said during the fight that this was yet another case of klitschko fighting up or down to his opponent . <end> <start> haye would make him fight up . <end> <start> rahman had him fighting down . <end> <start> the fight as also yet another example of why people crap on heavyweight fighting . <end> <start> it was n't interesting , was n't competitive , and you clearly had one guy ( rahman ) not in shape to fight for more than five rounds . <end> <start> and worse than that , he did n't even fight . <end> <start> in the sixth , he landed one punch . <end> <start> he spent a lot of time laying on the ropes starting in the third round , barely punching at all . <end> <start> the hbo team today was lampley , kellerman and lennox , and they did their usual bit when they watch a heavyweight fight with lennox in the booth , which means they made verbal love to lewis while lewis agreed with their assessment of him as better than everyone fighting today . <end> <start> they 're right , of course -- but we all know that . <end> <start> there was even one round where lennox decided , out loud , that he is better than wladimir klitschko . <end> <start> as always , an interesting group that teaches me a lot about the fights i 'm watching . <end>

<start> article posted on 08_._07_._2012 <end> <start> wladimir_klitschko stops tony_thompson in 6 with efficient execution <end> <start> heavyweight champion wladimir_klitschko once again displayed his dominance by scoring a sixth round stoppage against american contender tony_thompson . <end> <start> klitschko utilized good ring smarts and superior punching power to systematically break thompson down . <end> <start> the first round started cautiously with both fighters becoming reacquainted with each other in a tentative feeling out process . <end> <start> tony was exhibiting his trademark awkward movement and wladimir was measuring him with the left rangefinder . <end> <start> it was a relatively even round without much action , but klitschko landed the two best shots of the round even if tony threw a little more . <end> <start> thompson tried jumping on wladimir to start the second but the champion was prepared . <end> <start> klitschko followed this with a nice right hand followed by a short crisp combination . <end> <start> later in the round another klitschko right snuck in , and then a series of big rights backed the challenger into the ropes . <end> <start> thompson was wrestled down to the canvas a couple of times in this stanza , and wlad ’ s superior strength was evident . <end> <start> klitschko was patient and measured , and his approach was paying off in round two . <end> <start> in between rounds hall of fame trainer emanuel steward told klitschko he was mentally wearing thompson down with pressure , and this certainly appeared to be the case . <end> <start> in round three klitschko was again using his left hand to block jabs and establish range . <end> <start> klitschko was looking almost exclusively for right hands , and was not using the authoritative jab we are accustomed to seeing because of thompson ’ s awkwardness . <end> <start> thompson was throwing jabs that were mostly being blocked or missing the mark . <end> <start> while it was obvious thompson was having success in neutralizing wlad's jab , he was also being peppered with klitschko right hands that were inflicting far more damage than anything thompson was throwing . <end> <start> wladimir finally landed a solid jab almost halfway through the round , but his right hand was still the story of the fight . <end> <start> thompson landed a decent left later in the round , but klitschko was too elusive for him for the most part . <end> <start> it was another clear round for the champion . <end> <start> the fourth round was more of the same . <end> <start> the action was highlighted by a thudding right and a well timed combination from the champion . <end> <start> before the start of the fifth , steward urged wladimir to throw more jabs and to spend less time waiting in between attacks . <end> <start> as has been the case many times in the past , klitschko responded to steward ’ s instructions and executed with workmanlike precision . <end> <start> he started landing the jab more , and this enabled him to score with a booming right hand that sent thompson crashing to the canvas . <end> <start> tony rose to his feet and the action resumed with about 20 seconds left . <end> <start> the challenger held on to survive , but this was perhaps the beginning of the end . <end> <start> thompson came out to start the sixth and seemed to have regained his equilibrium . <end> <start> he was bouncing around , reacting to klitschko ’ s feints , and mostly retreating in a defensive posture . <end> <start> as the round progressed he was trying to fling the jab out , but klitschko was slowly measuring him up , cool as an assassin . <end> <start> klitschko began throwing the infrequent jab and landing more big rights . <end> <start> thompson was trying his best to survive , but then a vicious two - handed assault sent thompson down for the second time . <end> <start> to his credit , he managed to rise to his feet , but the referee then waved it off . <end> <start> this was klitschko ’ s second victory over thompson , and with it he improves to 58 - 3 with 51 wins coming by way of knockout . <end> <start> slowly but surely , wladimir klitschko is beginning to establish a strong legacy for himself . <end> <start> he may not always have the most crowd pleasing style , but he is intelligent , powerful , consistent , and extremely efficient at executing his game plan . <end> <start> the epix broadcast of the match made note of the following all - time heavyweight records in title fights : <end> <start> heavyweight title fights <end> <start> joe louis 26 - 1 <end> <start> muhammad ali 22 - 3 <end> <start> larry holmes 21 - 5 <end> <start> wladimir klitschko 19 - 2 <end> <start> lennox lewis 15 - 2 - 1 <end> <start> now of course this includes klitschko ’ s title reign as wbo champion as well as his current reign which began when he captured the ibf strap from chris byrd . <end> <start> many critics will note that the wbo was not universally recognized in high regard at the time klitschko held that title . <end> <start> even still , however , klitschko has won 16 fights in a row since losing to lamon brewster in april 2004 , and he was won 13 title fights in a row since his april 2006 victory over byrd . <end> <start> beyond that , he has rarely lost a round during that impressive stretch . <end> <start> given the current state of the heavyweight landscape , it is not inconceivable that klitschko may well top that list before all is said and done . <end>

<start> scientific consultations under endangered_species_act restored <end> <start> washington_,_dc , april_28_,_2009 <end> <start> the obama administration today revoked an eleventh - hour bush - era rule that undermined protections for plants and animals listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered_species_act . <end> <start> passed in january 2009 , the bush - era rule lifted the requirement that federal agencies consult wildlife experts with the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration before taking actions that could harm listed species . <end> <start> the bush move allowed federal agencies to decide for themselves if their own projects , such as roads , dams and mines , would hurt species . <end> <start> secretary of commerce gary_locke and secretary of the interior ken_salazar , who head the two agencies that administer the endangered_species_act , said their decision to again require consultation before action is based_on sound science . <end> <start> "by rolling_back this 11th hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law , " salazar said . <end> <start> "because science must serve as the foundation for decisions we make , federal agencies proposing to take actions that might affect threatened and endangered species will once again have to consult with biologists at the two departments , " he said . <end> <start> "for decades , the endangered species act has protected threatened species and their habitats , " said locke . <end> <start> "our decision affirms the administration's commitment to using sound science to promote conservation and protect the environment . " <end> <start> in march , president barack obama directed the secretaries to review the previous administration's section 7 regulation of the endangered species act , which governs interagency consultation . <end> <start> congress , in the 2009 omnibus appropriations act , specifically authorized the secretaries to revoke the regulation . <end> <start> locke and salazar said the two departments will conduct a joint review of the 1986 consultation regulations that are now once again in effect to determine if any improvements should be proposed . <end> <start> the endangered species act was signed into law in 1973 to protect imperiled species from extinction , as well as conserve the ecosystems and habitats necessary for their survival . <end> <start> today there are 1 , 009 species in the united states listed as endangered under the act - 409 animals and 600 plants . <end> <start> an additional 162 animals and 146 plants are listed as threatened . <end> <start> environmentalists and scientists who had lobbied against making consultation discretionary were pleased with the decision . <end> <start> betsy loyless , national audubon society senior vice president for advocacy and policy , said , "the obama administration has given a great gift to wildlife and to future generations . <end> <start> once again , our nation will follow the letter of the law and the advice of its own best experts before jeopardizing the future of threatened and endangered species . " <end> <start> the decision comes as president obama prepares to mark his first 100 days in office on wednesday . <end> <start> loyless said , "the president has capped his first hundred days with a serious step toward restoring our commitment to this nation's great natural heritage . " <end> <start> last friday , 1 , 300 biologists and three scientific societies representing some 20 , 000 scientists - the ornithological council , society for conservation biology and the wildlife society - sent separate letters to the interior and commerce departments urging them to overturn the last - minute bush rule change . <end> <start> "many federal agencies do not have the scientific expertise to determine the consequences of federal projects on endangered species and may have vested interests in the implementation of a project , " said stuart pimm , doris duke professor of conservation ecology at duke university , who helped organize the scientists' letter . <end> <start> pimm said the bush rule excluded from the process expert scientists who for decades have provided impartial review and critical analysis of proposed projects . <end> <start> alan thornhill , an ecologist and executive director of the society for conservation biology , said , "as the threats we face continue to evolve , federal scientists must be able to evaluate their consequences for imperiled species . <end> <start> putting boundaries on the science that informs the endangered species act fundamentally undermines the ability of science and scientists to protect our nation's biodiversity . " <end> <start> "politics plays a huge role in such decisions , " said michael hutchins , executive director and chief executive of the wildlife society . <end> <start> "expert review and oversight are critical . " <end> <start> francesca_grifo , director of union of concerned scientists' scientific integrity program , said lifting the requirement for consultation was one of a number of ways the bush administration weakened the act , and more work remains to be done . <end> <start> "several last - minute bush administration regulatory changes have undermined the scientific foundation of the endangered_species_act , and today the obama administration has begun to repair the damage , " she said . <end> <start> "the message from tens of thousands of scientists around the country is clear - these unwarranted changes fundamentally undermine our ability to protect imperiled plants and animals . " <end> <start> "today , the obama administration restored critical checks and balances to protect our nation's biodiversity , " said grifo . <end> <start> "but there is much more to be done . <end> <start> the obama administration must thoroughly review how science is used to ensure that our nation's imperiled species have a chance to survive - and thrive . " <end>
<start> obama_white_house reverses bush rule on protection of endangered species <end> <start> • interior and commerce departments agree <end> <start> • government wildlife experts to be consulted on development <end> <start> tuesday_28_april_2009_22_._34_bst <end> <start> the obama administration overturned one of the most controversial environmental measures of the george_bush era today , striking_down a rule that had weakened protection for endangered species . <end> <start> officials at the interior and commerce ministries said they had returned to a requirement that government wildlife experts sign_off on any new development - mining , logging or road construction - that could hurt animals , fish or plants that are at_risk of going_extinct . <end> <start> today's move was the latest in a series of declarations by obama officials meant to chip away at the bush environmental legacy . <end> <start> a number of those measures were put in place in the final hours of the bush administration , in what became known as "midnight regulations" . <end> <start> until last december , developers had been required for more than two decades to get approval from government wildlife experts before embarking on new projects . <end> <start> but the bush administration in its final days brought in a rule leaving it up to businesses to consult with government biologists on the impact of new development . <end> <start> environmentalists had accused bush of effectively gutting protections for threatened or endangered species , and activists had sent more than 70 , 000 petitions to officials in the obama administration urging them to cancel the "midnight regulation" . <end> <start> in a statement , the commerce secretary , gary locke , and the interior secretary , ken salazar , agreed . <end> <start> after a scientific reviewed ordered by obama last month , they said they had reached the conclusion that such protections were indeed necessary . <end> <start> "by rolling_back this 11th hour regulation we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law , the two men said in a statement . <end> <start> "federal agencies proposing to take actions that might affect threatened and endangered species will once again have to consult with biologists . " <end> <start> there was no word on another so - called midnight regulation that undermined protection for polar bear , an omission criticised by some activists today . <end> <start> the move , which had been anticipated , comes just 24 hours after salazar took steps against another midnight regulation . <end> <start> the interior secretary said he would ask the courts to overturn a last - minute rule that made it easier for coal mining operations engaged in mountaintop removal to dump dirt near streams . <end>
<start> obama overturns bush midnight rules on science , health_care <end> <start> mar_5_,_2009 <end> <start> controversial rulings enacted in the 11th hour by the bush administration are being examined for policy and legal implications by the obama administration . <end> <start> several regulations affecting health_care and the environment have been overturned . <end> <start> in his final months in office , former president george w . bush enacted several highly controversial policies that affect health care and wildlife . <end> <start> in just a_little_over_a_month in office , president barack_obama has sidelined or overturned several of them , and has also reached_back over the_years to reverse policies enacted during bush ’ s first_term . <end> <start> a bush administration draft plan to allow oil and gas drilling off the atlantic and pacific coasts was sidelined by the obama administration on feb . 10 . <end> <start> "to establish an orderly process that allows us to make wise decisions based on sound information , we need to set aside" the plan , said new interior secretary ken salazar who extended the public comment period on offshore drilling by six months . <end> <start> obama has maintained that expanded offshore drilling should be part of a larger energy blueprint developed out in the open with congress , not within the departments of commerce and interior department alone . <end> <start> on feb_._27 , the obama administration announced its intention to reverse the so - called “ medical conscience ” rule , following a 30 - day comment period . <end> <start> the rule gave health care workers the right to refuse to participate in services they consider immoral . <end> <start> the rule was vaguely worded and extended the right to refuse service to everyone from receptionists and janitors to hospital executives and insurance company ceos . <end> <start> opponents considered the rule , which took effect the day before obama ’ s inauguration , a thinly veiled maneuver to limit access to legal abortions , contraceptives , and living will directives . <end> <start> on march_3 , obama overturned another 11th hour bush regulation that weakened the endangered_species_act and pitted federal agencies against each_other . <end> <start> the regulation allowed federal agencies to sidestep scientific evidence gathered by u . s . fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service experts when launching construction projects that impact endangered wildlife . <end> <start> when overturning the regulation , obama said he was restoring "the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the endangered_species_act , a process undermined by past administrations . " <end> <start> the obama administration will also move quickly to reverse some older bush rulings . <end> <start> on january_30 , obama signed an executive order rescinding a 2001 bush policy change that barred u . s . financial aid to international organizations that provide or promote abortions . <end> <start> first implemented by president reagan and called the “ mexico city ” rule , the policy is reversed whenever there is a change in ideology in the white house . <end> <start> obama said the policy toward international family planning "has been used as a political wedge issue . " <end> <start> he said his administration would “ initiate a fresh conversation on family planning , working to find areas of common ground to best meet the needs of women and families at home and around the world . " <end> <start> the obama administration plans to head off many of bush ’ s midnight hour rules still in the pipeline before they take effect . <end> <start> on inauguration day , federal agency heads were sent a memo stating that they should freeze all bush regulations in the pipeline . <end> <start> office of management and budget director peter orszag followed up with a jan . 21 memo giving agency heads these options for dealing with bush - era “ rules which raise substantial questions of law or policy : ” extending the effective date of a rule , reopening the notice and comment period , issuing interim final rules , and deciding not to defend court challenges to bush administration rules . <end> <start> for a partial list of bush ’ s midnight regulations and their current status , visit propublica . <end>
<start> with just_over_a_month remaining in_office , the bush_administration loosened federal protection of plant and animal species threatened with extinction . <end> <start> on thursday , the interior_department announced a change to section_7_of_the_endangered_species_act , which required federal_agencies to consult with scientists at the fish_and_wildlife_service or the national_marine_fisheries_service to determine whether a project is likely to affect any listed species . <end> <start> under the new rule , federal agencies such as the federal highway administration can in many cases simply check with their own personnel to determine if their activities will harm any of the 1,247 animal and 747 plant species listed as endangered or threatened . <end> <start> `` the rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the american economy , '' said secretary of the interior dirk kempthorne . <end> <start> it started with the polar bears <end> <start> the rule change has its origins in a may announcement by the interior department that listed the polar bear as threatened because global warming is melting its habitat . <end> <start> it was the first animal to be listed because of climate change . <end> <start> in that announcement , interior secretary dirk kempthorne said that even though global climate change is the reason that the bear is on the endangered species list in the first place , that list is `` not the means , nor the method , nor the vehicle by which you can deal with global climate change . '' <end> <start> the interior department 's press release cites a may editorial from the washington post that endorses this view: <end> <start> that mr. kempthorne has to contort his agency to ensure that it does n't get dragged into setting us climate policy is simply more proof of the need for such a policy , supported by the white house and ratified by congress , that aims at sharply reducing greenhouse-gas emissions . <end> <start> though the polar bear deserves protection , the endangered species act is not the means and the fish and wildlife service is not the agency to arrest global warming . <end> <start> the release quotes the second sentence of that paragraph . <end> <start> so under the new rules , federal agencies that are undertaking a project need not check with fish and wildlife or national marine fisheries under these circumstances: <end> <start> where the action has no effect on a listed species or critical habitat , or <end> <start> where the action is wholly beneficial , or <end> <start> where the effects of the action can not be measured or detected in a manner that permits meaningful evaluation using the best available science , or <end> <start> where the effects of the action are the result of global processes and can not be reliably predicted or measured on the scale of species current range , or would result in an insignificant impact to a listed species , or are such that the potential risk of harm to a species is remote . <end> <start> reactions <end> <start> environmentalists are less than thrilled by this rule change . <end> <start> andrew wetzler , director of the natural resources defense council 's endangered species program , says his organization will probably sue: <end> <start> `` this administration has rejected anything with a whiff of science <end> <start> so before sulking out the back door , they are going after rules that require fish and wildlife service scientists to prevent harm to our last wild animals and places . <end> <start> despite today 's feel-good statements , we remain convinced that these changes are illegal . <end> <start> we will look at the final language when it is published tomorrow , but i think we will see them in court . '' <end> <start> defenders of the wildlife , who have filed suit along with greenpeace and the center for biological diversity , are similarly disgusted by the bush administration 's actions: <end> <start> `` this administration 's disdain for wildlife and the environment has never been more clear than it is today , '' said jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of defenders of wildlife and former director of the fish and wildlife service . <end> <start> `` for 35 years , the endangered species act has helped save and recover imperiled wildlife on the brink of extinction . <end> <start> now , with this administration facing its last days , they are doing everything they can to cement their anti-environmental legacy before the obama administration takes office . '' <end> <start> the us chamber of commerce welcomed the rule change . <end> <start> reversible ? <end> <start> obama says that he intends to reverse the rule change , along with other `` midnight rules '' made in the waning days of the bush presidency . <end> <start> but that may be easier said than done . <end> <start> propublica , a nonprofit investigative news organization , notes that while last-minute rules that have not yet taken effect can be quickly reversed by obama 's appointees or by executive order , rules that are in force when he takes office can not : <end> <start> rescinding a rule would require the new administration to restart the rulemaking process , which can take years and prompt legal challenges . <end> <start> another strategy that has been talked about lately - getting congress to disapprove the rules through the congressional review act - carries political risks and has been used only once before . <end> <start> the new endangered species rule takes effect nine days before obama 's inauguration . <end> <start> there is still a chance that the rule could be quickly reversed , however . <end> <start> usa today reports that rep. nick rahall ( d ) of west virginia , the chairman of the house natural resources committee , says that he will likely invoke the congressional review act , a rarely used law that gives congress 60 days to review and overrule regulations issued by government agencies . <end>
<start> apr 28 <end> <start> obama administration restores endangered_species_act protections ! <end> <start> today , interior secretary ken_salazar and commerce secretary gary_locke announced the restoration of rules under the endangered_species_act that help protect endangered species when government decisions or projects are implemented . <end> <start> the rules were weakened in the final days of the bush administration . <end> <start> the department of interior sent out this press release announcing the decision today . <end> <start> their decision requires federal agencies to once again consult with federal wildlife experts at the u_._s_._fish_and_wildlife_service and the_national_oceanic_and_atmospheric_administration before taking any action that may affect threatened or endangered species . <end> <start> the action will restore an important check - and - balance system that enables government projects to move_forward and at the same time protect at_-_risk species . <end> <start> the restoration of these protections is amazing news for our country ’ s wildlife , fish and plants on the brink of extinction . <end> <start> making this decision within the first 100 days of office is also an important symbol that america will once again respect science and environmental protections . <end> <start> the endangered species coalition is incredibly grateful to president obama , secretary locke and secretary salazar for their leadership on addressing the urgent environmental issues of species extinction and global warming . <end> <start> for more information , check out the esc statement . <end>
<start> the interior_department yesterday finalized rules changing the way it administers the endangered_species_act , enabling other government_agencies to decide on their own whether a project would harm an imperiled species without an independent scientific_review . <end> <start> interior secretary dirk kempthorne called the move `` a clarification '' he considered essential in order to narrow the law 's reach . <end> <start> `` the rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the american economy , '' kempthorne said , adding that agencies can bypass a review by either the fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration only `` in specific and limited instances where an action is not anticipated to harass , harm or kill a protected species . '' <end> <start> dale hall , who directs the fish and wildlife service , said the change did not mean that agencies could build dams , roads or other projects without taking into account the consequences . <end> <start> `` the agency still has the full responsibility to make that decision and to defend that decision , '' hall said , noting that the loss of an imperiled species , known as `` take , '' carries legal penalties . <end> <start> `` they 're still liable for take , if take occurs . '' <end> <start> hall said he was initially concerned about `` the compressed time frame '' in which the agency pushed through the rule change , which was unveiled in august , but he added that he did n't `` see any harm '' in kempthorne 's final decision . <end> <start> interior went ahead with the rule change one day after the environmental protection agency dropped two other controversial rules changes , saying they had come along too late in president bush 's term. white house spokesman tony fratto said the reason was that the administration had `` publicly and clearly stated our intention '' to enact the endangered species measure well before a self-imposed deadline on eleventh-hour rule changes . <end> <start> the agency received nearly 235,000 comments on the endangered species proposal , at least 208,000 of which were form letters decrying the rule . <end> <start> congressional democrats and environmentalists sharply criticized the administration for the interior department action . <end> <start> `` as the bush administration fades off into the sunset , it continues to take brazen pot shots at everything in sight , including america 's landmark conservation law , the endangered species act , '' said house resources committee chairman nick j. rahall ii ( d-w.va. ) , who said he would introduce legislation seeking to overturn the rule next year . <end> <start> separately yesterday , interior issued a finding limiting the protections that could be invoked to protect polar bears , which were listed as a threatened species this year , on the grounds that the bears are already protected under the marine mammals protection act . <end> <start> the finding means that the bears ' protected status could not be used to block activities such as oil and gas development outside their alaska habitat . <end> <start> `` we do not believe the science is there to make the causal link between activities in the lower 48 to the take of a polar bear , '' kempthorne said . <end> <start> `` to finally admit that the science compels the listing of the polar bear as threatened due to global warming , but then deny it the protections the endangered species act should provide , is nothing other than irresponsible and shameful , '' said jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of the advocacy group defenders of wildlife , adding that her group would sue to overturn the rule . <end>
<start> updated 8_:_41_p_._m_._est_,_tue_march_3_,_2009 <end> <start> obama overturns bush endangered species rule <end> <start> president obama on_tuesday overturned a last - minute bush administration regulation that many environmentalists claim weakened the endangered_species_act . <end> <start> the regulation , issued a few weeks before george w . bush left office , made it easier for federal agencies to skip consultations with government scientists before launching projects that could affect endangered wildlife . <end> <start> by overturning the regulation , obama said during an enthusiastic reception at the interior_department , he had restored "the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the endangered_species_act , a process undermined by past administrations . " <end> <start> under the bush administration rule , there was no need for a federal agency to consult with the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries services if that agency determined that no harm would come to an endangered species as a result of its project . <end> <start> but the determination of what "no harm" meant rested with agency bureaucrats instead of scientists . <end> <start> obama issued a memorandum that effectively suspends the regulation while ordering a review to determine whether it promotes "the purposes of the [ endangered_species_act ] . " <end> <start> "the work of scientists and experts in my administration , including right here in the interior department , will be respected , " obama said . <end> <start> "for more than three decades , the endangered species act has successfully protected our nation's most threatened wildlife , and we should be looking for ways to improve it , not weaken it . " <end> <start> environmental groups were quick to praise obama's action . <end> <start> "president obama's announcement will allow [ the endangered_species_act ] to do what it was intended : protect our nation's endangered plants and animals , " said andrew_wetzler , director of the natural resources defense council's endangered species program . <end> <start> "reversing the bush administration's midnight action will restore protections for our last wild_places and species . " <end> <start> obama also helped celebrate the 160th anniversary of the interior department on tuesday . <end> <start> "throughout our history , there's been a tension between those who've sought to conserve our natural resources for the benefit of future generations and those who have sought to profit from these resources , " he told department employees . <end> <start> "but i'm here to tell you this is a false choice . <end> <start> with smart , sustainable policies , we can grow our economy today and preserve the environment for ourselves , our children and our grandchildren . " <end>
<start> interior secretary dirk_kempthorne announced major changes thursday to the endangered_species_act , causing environmental_groups to charge that the `` midnight_rules `` set to go_into_effect before president-elect barack_obama takes_office are intended to eviscerate the nation 's premier wildlife-protection law . <end> <start> the regulations eliminate a requirement that federal agencies seek review by government scientists before approving logging , mining and construction projects to make sure the activities do n't endanger rare animals and plants . <end> <start> in addition , the regulations say the law could not be used to protect polar bears , walrus , mountain frogs and other species vulnerable to the effects of global warming . <end> <start> `` the bush administration is using this to go after our most imperiled wildlife and kick them when they are down , '' said janette brimmer , an attorney with earthjustice , an environmental group . <end> <start> `` the act is our nation 's most important law for protecting wildlife like wolves , grizzlies , salmon and lynx . '' <end> <start> reid cherlin , a spokesman for the obama-biden transition team , said , `` president-elect obama will review all 11th-hour regulations and will address them once he takes office . '' <end> <start> obama has said he does not favor changing the endangered species act . <end> <start> kempthorne , at a news conference in washington , said that he knew changes to the act would evoke controversy but that he is certain the new rules would clear up confusion over the law that had existed for years . <end> <start> `` nothing in the regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed , '' he said . <end> <start> law covers 1,400 species <end> <start> the law protects 1,400 species . <end> <start> in the last eight years , there has been a slowdown in adding new plants and animals , building a backlog of hundreds of species waiting for scientific review and approval , including california 's furry pacific fisher and sierra nevada yellow-legged frog . <end> <start> the interior department proposed the new regulations in may and since has received nearly 300,000 comments , the vast majority opposing the changes . <end> <start> hours after thursday 's announcement , three environmental groups , greenpeace , defenders of wildlife and center for biological diversity , filed a lawsuit in u.s. district court in san francisco seeking to halt regulations that they say are inconsistent with the act . <end> <start> the regulations do n't require federal agencies to seek consultation with u.s. fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service before approving projects , the lawsuit said . <end> <start> in congress , rep. edward markey , d-mass. , called a hearing to review the regulations and said members would work to restore the act. rep. nick rahall , d-w.va. , said members may try to eliminate the regulations by using a special congressional act that allows the review of newly adopted administrative rules . <end> <start> part of the new regulations prohibit regulators from taking into account the effects of greenhouse gases on habitats and on species . <end> <start> kempthorne said his legal advisers concluded that considering global warming a threat to the survival of the polar bear would require tracking emissions to a particular factory and determining how that would melt arctic ice and harm the bear . <end> <start> `` that 's completely wrong , and they 're just making that up , '' said attorney kassie siegel of the center for biological diversity , which is suing the federal government in an attempt to protect polar bears . <end> <start> federal agencies are supposed to look at sources of greenhouse gases from projects they approve , then analyze ways to reduce those emissions , siegel said . <end> <start> `` there 's no requirement to trace any molecule of ddt to the thinning of bald eagle eggs just as there 's no requirement to trace any molecule of carbon dioxide to the death of any particular polar bear , '' she said . <end> <start> in california , the requirement to consult with government biologists before construction projects is particularly crucial , said mark rockwell , california state representative of the endangered species coalition , an alliance of 50 environmental , business , hunting and fish and religious groups in the state . <end> <start> the u.s. forest service approves logging plans that might affect coastal coho salmon and steelhead , marbled murrelets and pacific fishers on national forests . <end> <start> the u.s. army corps of engineers give permits for filling wetlands . <end> <start> without the requirement , there 's no incentive for the agencies to seek consultation and a biological opinion , rockwell said . <end> <start> for example , the bureau of reclamation was forced by the current requirement to seek biological opinions on whether the amount of water being diverted from the southern part of the sacramento-san joaquin river delta would hurt the delta smelt or harm chinook salmon . <end> <start> protections found lacking <end> <start> environmental groups challenged opinions that water flows for the fish were adequate , and won decisions agreeing that the protections were indeed lacking in the plans . <end> <start> `` it was the biological opinions that led to the challenges , '' rockwell said . <end> <start> `` if you do n't have an opinion , you have nothing to challenge .

" <end> <start> the_ornithological_council , society_for_conservation_biology_and_the_wildlife_society , which collectively represent more than 20 , 000 scientists , also sent a letter today asking the interior and commerce secretaries to rescind the changes and make other improvements to the scientific base of the endangered_species_act . <end> <start> "as the threats we face continue to evolve , federal scientists must be able to evaluate their consequences for imperiled species . <end> <start> putting boundaries on the science that informs the endangered species act fundamentally undermines the ability of science and scientists to protect our nation's biodiversity , " said alan thornhill , an ecologist and executive director of the society for conservation biology . <end> <start> "politics plays a huge role in such decisions , " said michael hutchins , executive director and ceo of the wildlife society . <end> <start> "expert review and oversight are critical . " <end> <start> the rules generated concern when they were hastily pushed through at the end of the last administration with little discussion or debate . <end> <start> the obama administration has addressed the rule change , but has not formally overturned it . <end> <start> on march 3 , president obama directed the commerce and interior departments to review it , stating that "we should be looking at ways to strengthen [ the endangered species act ] —not weaken it . " <end> <start> president obama also directed federal agencies to continue consulting with scientists on projects that might harm endangered species . <end> <start> congress also has taken steps to address the problem . <end> <start> a provision in an omnibus spending bill signed by president obama on march 11 allows interior secretary ken salazar and commerce secretary gary locke to rescind the rule changes within 60 days . <end> <start> secretary salazar has said publicly that he is concerned about the rule changes , but has not indicated that he will act by the may 9 deadline . <end> <start> on friday , it was reported that the interior department sent a rule to the white house office of management and budget that addresses the interagency review process but not other parts of the rules that the scientists want repealed , particularly the limits on what kinds of information can be used in determining how to protect the polar bear . <end> <start> the content of the rule was not released . <end> <start> the two letters also urge the administration to take a more comprehensive look at how science can better inform decision - making under the endangered species act . <end> <start> according to the scientists , other recent changes create unrealistic deadlines for scientific consultations and limit the types of information federal scientists can consider when evaluating federal projects . <end> <start> "these changes chop down the role of science in governmental decision - making , leaving less than a stump behind . <end> <start> the loss of science translates into real loss of biodiversity , " said francesca grifo , a biodiversity expert and director of the union of concerned scientists' scientific integrity program . <end> <start> "the new rules weaken the scientific foundation of the endangered species act and make it easier to base decisions on politics instead of science . <end> <start> in giving the departments the authority to roll back these rules , congress has given the american people a gift , and the department secretaries need to open it . " <end>
<start> the bush_administration issued two late-term regulations on thursday that environmentalists say weaken federal protection for endangered species but that interior department officials defended as blocking a `` back-door '' attempt to regulate emissions that contribute to global warming . <end> <start> conservation groups sued to block the new rules , reigniting a fight over so-called midnight regulation that had seemed to die down a day earlier when the administration declined to impose looser air pollution rules that environmentalists had feared . <end> <start> previously , federal agencies were required to consult with scientists who specialized in particular species before proceeding with a project like a road or dam . <end> <start> the project could not go forward unless the specialist certified that no harm would come to endangered plants or wildlife . <end> <start> the rules announced thursday would allow federal agencies to bypass those scientists in some cases if the agencies determined that the endangered species would not be harmed . <end> <start> the revision was finalized after four months of deliberation and over the objections of what officials said were the bulk of nearly 235,000 public comments on the change . <end> <start> the updated rules also bar agencies from stopping a project because its emissions might contribute to global warming . <end> <start> opponents call the change particularly objectionable for the polar bear , which has seen its habitat shrink as arctic ice caps melt . <end> <start> the government declared polar bears a threatened species this year . <end> <start> interior secretary dirk kempthorne called the rule changes `` narrow '' and a `` common-sense '' approach to species protection . <end> <start> he stressed that agencies could still consult with species scientists if they chose , and he reiterated his belief that climate change regulation is a `` wholly inappropriate use of the endangered species act . '' <end> <start> kempthorne acknowledged internal debate over the changes , but he and other administration officials said they tweaked the rule in response to public comments . <end> <start> environmental groups panned them anyway . <end> <start> janette brimmer , an attorney with earthjustice , said the administration was `` using global warming as a stalking horse to undo species protections on a broad scale . '' <end> <start> andrew wetzler , director of the natural resources defense council 's endangered species program , was blunt: <end> <start> `` we will see them in court . '' <end> <start> environmentalists have tussled with the administration in its waning days over oil and gas drilling leases near national parks and oil shale development across the western u.s . <end> <start> they cheered wednesday , however , when the environmental protection agency said it would not revise two air pollution standards . <end> <start> white house officials say they 've worked hard to minimize the kind of end-of-term rulemaking that president bill clinton engaged in heavily . <end> <start> many of the late rules could be difficult for president-elect barack obama to overturn without in a lengthy process , though a little-used law could allow congress to void them . <end> <start> the house select committee on energy independence and global warming held a hearing on thursday into bush 's late energy and environmental rulemaking . <end> <start> committee chairman rep. edward markey ( d-mass. ) said the rules issued thursday showed the administration was `` determined to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on our nation .

" <end>
<start> the us interior and commerce departments reported dec._11 final proposed changes to the endangered_species_act , which interior secretary dirk_a._kempthorne said were not as extensive as originally planned . <end> <start> `` the rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the american economy , '' kempthorne said . <end> <start> `` it has been revised since it was proposed in august because the public made suggestions we could use to improve it , '' he said . <end> <start> the proposed changes are scheduled to appear in the dec. 12 federal register . <end> <start> `` what we are doing is clarifying the threshold for consultation to occur . <end> <start> if science can not draw a direct causal link between an action and an effect on a listed species , as is currently the case for global processes like climate change , than consultation under the esa is not necessary , '' kempthorne maintained . <end> <start> congressional critics and environmental organizations immediately criticized the proposal . <end> <start> `` the bush administration appears to be determined to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on our nation , '' said edward j. markey ( d-mass. ) , chairman of the house select committee on energy independence and global warming . <end> <start> `` today 's announcement that they will be removing fish and wildlife experts from key decisions to protect the safety of iconic animals like the polar bear from global warming 's effects is absurd and a recipe for disaster , '' markey said . <end> <start> andrew wetzler , director of the natural resources defense council 's endangered species program , commented, <end> <start> `` this administration has rejected anything with a whiff of science , so before skulking out the back door they are going after rules that require [ us ] fish and wildlife service scientists to prevent harm to our last wild animals and places . <end> <start> despite today 's feel-good statements , we remain convinced that these changes are illegal . <end> <start> we will look at the final language when it is published tomorrow , but i think we will see them in court . '' <end> <start> scope of exceptions <end> <start> but kempthorne noted that federal agencies would be required to follow existing consultation procedures except in specific , limited instances where a proposed action is not expected to have adverse impacts on any member of an esa-listed species and would satisfy one of the following conditions: <end> <start> it must be wholly beneficial , have no effect on a listed species or its critical habitat , have effects which could not be measured or detected in a manner that permits meaningful evaluation , or it must be the result of global processes that can not be reliably predicted or measured on the scale of the species ' current range . <end> <start> agencies still would be able to voluntarily engage in the consultation process , the secretary emphasized . <end> <start> he said the final proposed regulations contain fewer opportunities for agencies to proceed without consultation than what was originally envisioned . <end> <start> nothing in the proposals requires that a federal agency bypass consultation , nor does it preclude any federal agency from seeking the expertise of the fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service or from taking advantage of expertise that may be available from state and local agencies , universities , nongovernment organizations , or other sources , according to kempthorne . <end> <start> any federal agency may avail itself of expertise offered by fws and nmfs in exactly the same manner as under current regulations if it determines it has any limitations to make determinations under the esa or believes that it does not have the scientific expertise to make an accurate assessment of a project 's impacts on listed species and critical habitat , he said . <end> <start> moreover , nothing in the proposals relieves an agency of its responsibilities to ensure that listed species are not harmed during completion of a federal action , regardless of whether consultation occurs or not , kempthorne said . <end> <start> in cases where an action agency determines that consultation is not required and harm to a listed species results , full civil and criminal penalties , as laid out by other sections of the esa , remain in effect , he indicated . <end>
<start> obama reverses bush on species protection measure <end> <start> march_04_,_2009 <end> <start> in a move that will subject a number of government projects to enhanced environmental and scientific scrutiny , president obama is restoring a requirement that u . s . agencies consult with independent federal experts to determine whether their actions might harm threatened and endangered species . <end> <start> the presidential memorandum issued yesterday , which marks yet another reversal of former president george_w_._bush's environmental legacy , will revive a decades - old practice under the endangered_species_act that calls for agencies to consult with either the fish_and_wildlife_service or the national_oceanic_and_atmospheric_administration on whether their projects could affect imperiled species . <end> <start> on dec . 16 , the bush administration allowed agencies to waive such reviews if they decided , on their own , that the actions would not harm vulnerable plants and animals . <end> <start> obama , who visited the interior department to commemorate its 160th anniversary , said he had instructed interior and commerce department officials to review the bush rules . <end> <start> in the meantime , according to the memorandum , officials should "follow the prior longstanding consultation and concurrence practices" that call for independent reviews . <end> <start> "the work of scientists and experts in my administration , including here at the interior department , will be respected , " obama said . <end> <start> "with smart , sustainable policies , we can grow our economy today and preserve the environment . " <end> <start> environmentalists and scientists welcomed the move , but business officials said it could delay federally funded projects that could help revive the nation's economy : all of them agreed it would prompt a second look at several initiatives adopted by the bush administration in its final months in office . <end> <start> earthjustice lawyer janette brimmer , whose group had challenged the bush rule in federal district court in california , said she expected that the new administration would reexamine two pending projects : a bureau of land management plan for overseeing oregon's forests , which was finalized on dec . 30 and could affect protected species such as the northern spotted owl ; and construction of the white pine coal - fired power plant in nevada . <end> <start> "i think the obama administration now is going to take a step back on these projects . <end> <start> it needs to bring science back into the equation , " brimmer said , adding that her group will not drop its lawsuit until it can assess how the new policy is working . <end> <start> francesca grifo of the union of concerned scientists , an activist group , said the switch would help guard against the potential conflicts of interest and lack of expertise that could color decision - making by any agency hoping to press ahead with a particular project . <end> <start> "after years of scientific scandal , the interior department and its partner agencies need desperately to regain credibility by making decisions with honesty , clarity and transparency , " grifo said . <end> <start> but william l . kovacs , the u . s . chamber of commerce's vice president of environment , technology and regulatory affairs , said that reviving another layer of review "will result in even greater delays to projects - - including stimulus - backed , job - creating projects - - as agencies now grapple with the prospect of lengthy interagency consultations to determine , for instance , if a bridge project in florida contributes to the melting of arctic ice . <end> <start> this is such a departure from the spirit and the letter of the endangered species act that we wonder if the law's drafters would even recognize it today . " <end> <start> the latest policy shift follows several other administration actions revamping environmental policies , including a reexamination of fuel economy standards and offshore oil drilling ; a new review of whether to grant california and other states the right to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions from vehicles ; and the endorsement of a new international treaty negotiation on global mercury emissions . <end> <start> house natural resources committee chairman nick j . rahall ii ( d - w . va . ) , who had been seeking to overturn bush's endangered species rule through legislation , called the announcement "one more indication that the new administration truly represents change for the better and is committed to the protection of our natural resources and our environment . " <end> <start> officials said the move is unlikely to trigger broad use of the endangered species act to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions . <end> <start> while the bush rule specifically prohibited endangered species consultations on the basis of "global processes" such as climate change , an interior official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that under the new policy , such a review would be triggered only if scientific evidence suggested "a causal connection" between emissions from a federal project and its effect on an imperiled species or an identifiable part of its habitat . <end>

'' <end> <start> inslee noted the administration 's recent two-step maneuver in the chukchi sea off the north coast of alaska . <end> <start> the fish and wildlife service formally listed the polar bear under the endangered species act , due to the threat from global warming . <end> <start> ignoring the listing , the feds ' minerals management service proceeded to sell oil leases where the bears live . <end> <start> the bush administration finalized a retroactive justification on thursday . <end> <start> it created a `` special rule '' for polar bears , allowing oil and gas drilling , as long as oil companies obey the marine mammal protection act . <end> <start> `` polar bears do n't need a listing . <end> <start> they need ice , '' said inslee . <end> <start> inslee noted the role of the late sen. henry jackson , d-wash. , who backed oil development in the arctic and helped write the endangered species act . <end> <start> `` senator jackson and others had the foresight and intelligence to say : let us allow the expertise of government scientists to be tapped before decisions are made , '' inslee added . <end> <start> `` that 's what the consultation process does . <end> <start> it has been used to good effect in our state . '' <end> <start> critics of the endangered species act often substitute anecdote for fact . <end> <start> they 've argued that consultation with government scientists means holdups and more work . <end> <start> in a filing with the interior department , however , the natural resources defense council noted that no evidence of delay and cost was produced to support relaxing the law . <end> <start> quite the contrary . <end> <start> the new policy nixes informal consultation between agencies intended to determine whether a project needs more formal and detailed environmental review . <end> <start> the likely result will be `` erroneous findings '' by agencies , argued the nrdc . <end> <start> what 's the consequence ? <end> <start> project opponents will get grounds to sue . <end> <start> `` we will look at the final ( rule ) language when it is published tomorrow , but i think we will see them in court , '' said andrew welzler of the nrdc . <end> <start> putting teeth back in the endangered species act , and reversing the new rule , presents a tricky , time-consuming task for the obama administration . <end> <start> the makeup of obama 's environmental team has surfaced in recent days . <end> <start> it is urban , and largely eastern . <end> <start> the incoming environmental protection agency boss , lisa jackson , has worked as new jersey 's environmental commissioner . <end> <start> soon-to-be senior white house aide carol browner , an al gore protagonist , is from florida . <end> <start> obama brass would be well advised to turn for help to the pacific northwest and mountain west . <end> <start> our government leaders have dealt with tricky issues involving endangered species act listings of puget sound salmon runs and orcas . <end> <start> east coast environmentalists , in high government posts , proved tone-deaf and clumsy when dealing with endangered species issues in the clinton and carter administrations . <end> <start> what 's needed now is political savvy , plus what george w. bush , in his 2000 campaign , described as `` sound science .

<start> obama administration flips bush endangered species ruling <end> <start> 04 / 28 / 09 07 : 35 pm et <end> <start> federal agencies again will have to consult with government wildlife experts before taking_actions that could have an impact on threatened or endangered species . <end> <start> the obama administration said tuesday it was overturning a rule change made in_the_final_weeks of the bush presidency . <end> <start> officials at the interior and commerce departments said they have reimposed the consultation requirement that assured the government's top biologists involved in species protection will have_a_say in federal action that could harm plants , animals and fish that are at_risk of extinction . <end> <start> such consultation had been required for more than two decades until the bush administration made it optional in rules issued last december , just weeks before the change in administrations . <end> <start> environmentalists argued that the change severely reduced the protection afforded under the federal endangered species act . <end> <start> "by rolling_back this eleventh - hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law" and that top science will be the foundation of the decision_making , said interior secretary ken_salazar . <end> <start> commerce secretary gary locke added : "our decision affirms the administration's commitment to using sound science to promote conservation and protect the environment . " <end> <start> agencies in the two department's share responsibility for managing and enforcing the endangered species act and employ the government's top scientists in species protection . <end> <start> in march , president barack obama issued an executive order putting the bush rule change on hold . <end> <start> congress followed by giving specific authorization for the interior and commerce departments to revoke the action , avoiding a long and complicated regulatory process . <end> <start> environmentalists widely praised tuesday's action , but some expressed dismay that salazar didn't also rescind a rule that limits the protection to the polar bear , which last year was declared as "threatened" under the endangered species act because of disappearing arctic sea ice as a result of climate change . <end> <start> the bush administration issued a rule that prohibits an agency from taking into account indirect adverse impacts on the polar bear from activities outside of the arctic region : for example carbon dioxide emissions that are linked to global warming and , therefore , the loss of arctic sea ice . <end> <start> congress authorized that rule to be revoked as well , but the interior department said no decision had yet been made on the matter . <end> <start> "from our perspective the job is half done , " said noah greenwald of the center for biological diversity , an advocacy group . <end> <start> "the polar bear's arctic sea ice habitat is melting away . <end> <start> if the ( bush ) special rule is not struck down the polar bear is likely to be the first large mammal to go extinct due to global warming in the united states . " <end> <start> the end of the long - standing requirement _ dating back to 1986 _ of interagency consultation with the interior and commerce agencies on endangered species protection produced a firestorm in both congress and within the environmental and conservation communities . <end> <start> for years , agencies involved in thousands of federal activities _ from issuing clean air rules to approving highway or dam construction _ have had to consult not only their own experts but also biologists at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to ensure the activities did not harm plants , animals or fish that are protected by the endangered species act . <end> <start> developers and business groups argued that the consultation caused unneeded delays and increased the cost of projects . <end> <start> the bush administration made the independent consultation optional , arguing that it was a minor shift in policy . <end> <start> one impetus for the rule change was concern by the bush administration that the endangered species act might be used as a back door to regulate greenhouse gases as a way to combat climate change . <end> <start> the interior department earlier had declared the polar bear a threatened species because of the loss of arctic sea ice , a change attributed to global warming . <end> <start> salazar and lock said the two departments will jointly decide if any changes are needed to improve the interagency consultation procedures . <end> <start> the fish and wildlife service , which is part of the interior department , has jurisdiction over plants and animals , while noaa , part of the commerce department , deals with fish species that are at risk of extinction . <end>
<start> just six_weeks before president-elect barack_obama takes_office , the bush_administration issued revised endangered species regulations thursday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming <end> <start> the changes , which will go into effect in about 30 days , were completed in just four months . <end> <start> but they could take obama much longer to reverse . <end> <start> they will eliminate some of the mandatory , independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams , power plants , timber sales and other projects , a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases . <end> <start> the rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project 's contribution to increased global warming . <end> <start> interior department officials described the changes as `` narrow , '' but admitted that the regulations were controversial inside the agency . <end> <start> environmentalists viewed them as eroding the protections for endangered species . <end> <start> interior officials said federal agencies could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis , and that other parts of the law will ensure that species are protected . <end> <start> `` nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed , '' said interior secretary dirk kempthorne in a conference call with reporters . <end> <start> current rules require biologists in the fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service to sign off on projects even when it is determined that they are not likely to harm species . <end> <start> the rule finalized thursday would do away with that requirement , reducing the number of consultations so that the government 's experts can focus on cases that pose the greatest harm to wildlife , officials said . <end> <start> but environmentalists said that the rule changes would put decisions about endangered species into the hands of agencies with a vested interest in advancing a project and with little expertise about wildlife . <end> <start> several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court in san francisco hours after the rule 's announcement . <end> <start> jamie rappaport clark , a former director of the fish and wildlife service and a vice president of defenders of wildlife , said thursday that the changes target the `` absolute heart of the endangered species act . '' <end> <start> clark told a house hearing on the bush administration 's last-minute environmental regulations that these changes remove `` a system of checks and balances that provides an essential safety net for imperiled animals and plants . '' <end> <start> between 1998 and 2002 , the fish and wildlife service conducted 300,000 consultations . <end> <start> the national marine fisheries service , which evaluates projects affecting marine species , conducts about 1,300 reviews each year . <end> <start> the reviews have helped safeguard protected species such as bald eagles , florida panthers and whooping cranes . <end> <start> a federal government handbook from 1998 described the consultations as `` some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species . '' <end> <start> the bush administration worked diligently to get the change in place before obama took over , corralling 15 experts in washington in october to sort through 250,000 written comments from the public on the revisions in 32 hours . <end> <start> obama has said he would work to reverse the changes . <end> <start> but because the rule takes effect before he is sworn in , he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process . <end> <start> house natural resources committee chairman rep. nick rahall , d-w.va. , said he would seek to overturn the regulations using the congressional review act after consulting with other democratic leaders . <end> <start> the rarely used law allows congress to review new federal regulations . <end> <start> congress has opposed similar changes to the endangered species protections in the past . <end> <start> in 2003 , the bush administration imposed similar rules that would have allowed agencies to approve new pesticides and wildfire reduction projects without seeking the opinion of government scientists . <end> <start> the pesticide rule was later overturned in court . <end> <start> the interior department , along with the forest service , is currently being sued over the rule governing wildfire prevention . <end> <start> in 2005 , the house passed a bill that would have made similar changes to the endangered species act , but the bill died in the senate . <end> <start> oklahoma sen. james inhofe , the leading republican on the senate environment and public works committee , said in a statement the new regulations were `` common-sense changes to a law much overdue for reform . '' <end> <start> there are a handful of other environmental regulations still pending before bush leaves office , including a rule to exempt large agricultural operations from reporting releases of ammonia and other hazardous air pollutants . <end> <start> they must be finalized by dec. 19 in order for them go into effect before jan. 20 . <end> <start> in a related development , the interior department also finalized thursday a special rule for the polar bear , a species that was listed as threatened in may because of global warming . <end> <start> the rule would allow oil and gas exploration in areas where the bears live , as long as the companies comply with the marine mammal protection act . <end>
<start> obama administration overturns rule that weakened endangered_species_act <end> <start> april_28_,_2009 <end> <start> interior secretary ken_salazar announced today that the obama administration will reverse an endangered_species_act ( esa ) regulation that allowed federal agencies to go_ahead with actions that may impact endangered species without consulting with experts , essentially circumventing the role of conservation scientists in such decisions . <end> <start> "by rolling_back this eleventh - hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law" said salazar . <end> <start> the change to the esa was made last december by the bush administration and drew heavy criticism from environmental and conservation groups . <end> <start> at the time , during heavy campaigning , obama stated that he opposed the last minute rule changes with a spokesman stating : “ as president , senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush . ” <end> <start> darin schroeder , vice president for conservation advocacy at the environmental organization , american bird conservancy , agreed with salazar ’ s decision . <end> <start> “ we are gratified secretary salazar and secretary locke acted to restore the endangered species act to its intended strength . <end> <start> the consultation process is one of the cornerstones of the esa , and one of the key checks and balances that ensures protection for the 90 birds and 1 , 263 other animals and plants it covers . ” <end> <start> another anticipated ruling regarding polar bears has not been announced yet . <end> <start> while the bush administration found that melting ice in the arctic due to climate change was endangering polar bears , they ruled that the esa could not used to regulate carbon emissions in order to protect the polar bear . <end> <start> salazar must make a judgment on this rule by may 9th . <end> <start> “ secretary salazar took an important step today toward restoring needed protections for endangered species , ” said noah greenwald , biodiversity program director for the center for biological diversity . <end> <start> “ but he still needs to rescind the special rule for the polar bear , which amounts to a death sentence for the majestic bear because it exempts greenhouse gas emissions from regulation . ” <end>
<start> the bush_administration on thursday eliminated 35-year-old regulations in the endangered_species_act that required an independent scientific review of proposed federal projects to determine whether they imperil protected plants and animals . <end> <start> instead , federal agencies undertaking projects like road and power plant construction or oil and gas drilling will make their own assessment . <end> <start> without the independent reviews , such projects could be accelerated . <end> <start> as part of the changes announced by interior secretary dirk kempthorne in the final days of the bush administration , the department finalized an interim rule that allows oil and gas drilling in polar bear habitat off alaska 's coast . <end> <start> the rule change is designed to prevent the endangered species act from being used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , essentially making climate change policy . <end> <start> kempthorne , who characterized the new rules as a common-sense streamlining of bureaucratic processes , acknowledged that there was disagreement within the department regarding the rules , which take effect in 30 days . <end> <start> under current law , agencies must submit any plans that could harm species on the endangered list for review by scientists at the u.s. fish and wildlife service , which enforces the endangered species act . <end> <start> the process has been criticized by home builders groups and the oil and gas industry for delaying costly projects . <end> <start> the consultation requirement was intended as more than just a check and balance . <end> <start> jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of defenders of wildlife and director of fish and wildlife under president clinton , said the consultation process resolved the problem of `` mission conflict '' between agencies . <end> <start> the department of defense , for example , might not understand why an endangered plant should be considered when expanding a bombing range . <end> <start> `` the problem is the agencies do n't always properly consider , understand or protect species in their habitat because they are focused on the pursuit of their primary mission , '' clark said . <end> <start> `` it 's hard for the biologists to satisfy their responsibility to protect species if the agency perceives it affects their primary mission . '' <end> <start> president-elect barack obama said he would reverse the rule changes , as have some members of congress . <end> <start> but that requires a lengthy rule-making process . <end> <start> in the house , members can invoke the rarely used congressional review act to overturn the regulations . <end> <start> `` these changes are going to result in more species being put in jeopardy , '' clark said . <end> <start> `` but more importantly , we are not going to know what we do n't know anymore . '' <end> <start> officials said agencies would still be held liable if they approved projects that harmed threatened or endangered species . <end> <start> kempthorne also noted that any federal agency could choose to informally consult with the fish and wildlife service at any time . <end> <start> h. dale hall , director of fish and wildlife , said he had concerns about how fast the estimated 235,000 public comments were processed . <end> <start> staff assigned to the job spent eight hours a day tabulating the comments . <end> <start> working under strict time restraints , agency employees had nine seconds to read each letter , according to one calculation . <end> <start> officials said that more than 200,000 of the comments opposed the rule change . <end> <start> attempts to revise the endangered species act have been rebuffed by congress in recent years . <end> <start> sen. barbara boxer ( d-calif. ) said thursday 's actions were another assault on the law . <end> <start> `` these midnight regulations are part of a continuing effort by the bush administration to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door and weaken protections for our nation 's endangered species , '' she said in a statement . <end> <start> `` i believe they are illegal , and if similar regulations had been in place , they would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle , the grizzly bear and the gray whale , '' boxer said . <end> <start> environmental groups , which took the administration to court to force it to list the polar bear , vowed to continue the legal battle . <end> <start> three groups , the center for biological diversity , greenpeace and defenders of wildlife , filed suit in san francisco hours after the changes were announced , arguing that the regulations failed to follow the public review process . <end> <start> `` the bush administration has repackaged the same old lump of coal as a holiday present for the polar bear , and once again handed its friends in the oil industry a huge gift , '' said kassie siegel , climate program director at the center for biological diversity and lead author of the 2005 petition to list polar bears . <end> <start> `` these regulations seem designed to drive the polar bear extinct . '' <end> <start> the rule regarding polar bears comes seven months after that animal became the first to be placed on the endangered species list primarily because of global climate change . <end> <start> the melting of sea ice is threatening the polar bear with extinction . <end> <start> this summer , scores of polar bears were observed swimming in open seas , far from land or ice floes . <end> <start> but kempthorne said that he would n't allow the 1973 law to be used as a `` back door for implementing climate-change policy . '' <end> <start> to that end , he clarified regulations addressing threats to polar bear habitat : greenhouse emissions from automobiles , power plants and other human activities . <end> <start> the act requires federal agencies to designate habitat critical to the creature 's survival , then protect it by strict enforcement . <end> <start> kempthorne said that according to his reading , court rulings require pinpointing a specific source of a threat to habitat -- something that he said was scientifically impossible . <end> <start> that interpretation of the courts ' opinions gives the government few options to protect polar bear habitat . <end>
<start> president obama overturns endangered_species_rule bush instated <end> <start> former president bush had enacted legislation that could have put more animals in danger <end> <start> mar_4_,_2009 <end> <start> in a move that could anger some people on the other side of the aisle , president obama overturned an administration regulation that could have possibly weakened the stability of the endangered_species_act . <end> <start> before former president george w . bush left office , he passed legislation that would have allowed federal agencies to skip consultations before launching projects that could affect endangered wildlife . <end> <start> this could have put more animals at risk , and while it would have eliminated a lot of red tape in the process , it could have been more risky to endangered animals than necessary . <end> <start> the problem with the legislation by bush was that it was taking scientists out of the equation , and basically removing the most knowledgeable people from the equation . <end> <start> it would have given a lot of additional power to federal agencies , but stripped a lot of the rights that the endangered species act gives to the animals which it seeks to protect . <end> <start> while the act is not perfect in its implementation or enforcement , undermining by removing any "teeth" that it might have was a big step in the wrong direction . <end> <start> president obama has already received immense support from environmentalists for this move , and by overturning something the bush administration put in place , he showed that he is also willing to step up to the plate on issues such as these . <end> <start> by flat out declaring that it is necessary to ensure that no harm will come to endangered species as the result of new projects , it gives the endangered species act more strength , and does a lot to further the cause of environmentalists looking to protect these animals . <end> <start> with scientists being put back into the equation , it gives a lot of hope that the threatened wildlife will stand a better chance at surviving over the long term . <end> <start> it was a questionable move when bush made the move to approve the last - minute legislation during his second term , and while there were a lot of objections , nothing could really be done at the time . <end> <start> with an eye toward the future , president obama made a really smart decision by bringing scientists back into the endangered species fold , and surely helped to save a number of animals that could have otherwise been put at risk . <end>
<start> in a move environmental_groups says strikes at the heart of the endangered_species_act , the bush_administration on thursday announced a new rule that would let federal_agencies decide on their own whether their projects harm endangered species , instead of requiring them in many cases to get a second opinion from federal wildlife experts . <end>
<start> biologists call_on obama administration to overturn bush rules that cut science out of endangered species decisions <end> <start> interior and commerce secretaries must act by may 9 <end> <start> washington - april 27 - <end> <start> more than 1 , 300 federal and independent scientists with biological expertise and three leading scientific societies today called_on the interior and commerce departments to overturn rule changes made in_january that weaken the scientific foundation of the endangered_species_act . <end> <start> in a letter , the scientists urged the department secretaries to rescind changes to endangered_species_act regulations that allow federal agencies to decide for themselves if their own projects - - such as roads , dams and mines - - would threaten imperiled species . <end> <start> previously , federal agencies were required to consult with biologists at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or national marine fisheries service before undertaking or permitting projects . <end> <start> "many federal agencies do not have the scientific expertise to determine the consequences of federal projects on endangered species and may have vested interests in the implementation of a project , " said stuart pimm , doris duke professor of conservation ecology at duke university , who helped organize the scientists' letter . <end> <start> "the new rules exclude expert scientists - - who for decades have provided impartial review and critical analysis - - from the process . " <end> <start> the ornithological council , society for conservation biology and the wildlife society , which collectively represent more than 20 , 000 scientists , also sent a letter today asking the interior and commerce secretaries to rescind the changes and make other improvements to the scientific base of the endangered species act . <end> <start> "as the threats we face continue to evolve , federal scientists must be able to evaluate their consequences for imperiled species . <end> <start> putting boundaries on the science that informs the endangered species act fundamentally undermines the ability of science and scientists to protect our nation's biodiversity , " said alan thornhill , an ecologist and executive director of the society for conservation biology . <end> <start> "politics plays a huge role in such decisions , " said michael hutchins , executive director and ceo of the wildlife society . <end> <start> "expert review and oversight are critical . " <end> <start> the rules generated concern when they were hastily pushed through at the end of the last administration with little discussion or debate . <end> <start> the obama administration has addressed the rule change , but has not formally overturned it . <end> <start> on march 3 , president obama directed the commerce and interior departments to review it , stating that "we should be looking at ways to strengthen [ the endangered species act ] - - not weaken it . " <end> <start> president obama also directed federal agencies to continue consulting with scientists on projects that might harm endangered species . <end> <start> congress also has taken steps to address the problem . <end> <start> a provision in an omnibus spending bill signed by president obama on march 11 allows interior secretary ken salazar and commerce secretary gary locke to rescind the rule changes within 60 days . <end> <start> secretary salazar has said publicly that he is concerned about the rule changes , but has not indicated that he will act by the may 9 deadline . <end> <start> on friday , it was reported that the interior department sent a rule to the white house office of management and budget that addresses the interagency review process but not other parts of the rules that the scientists want repealed , particularly the limits on what kinds of information can be used in determining how to protect the polar bear . <end> <start> the content of the rule was not released . <end> <start> the two letters also urge the administration to take a more comprehensive look at how science can better inform decision - making under the endangered species act . <end> <start> according to the scientists , other recent changes create unrealistic deadlines for scientific consultations and limit the types of information federal scientists can consider when evaluating federal projects . <end> <start> "these changes chop down the role of science in governmental decision - making , leaving less than a stump behind . <end> <start> the loss of science translates into real loss of biodiversity , " said francesca grifo , a biodiversity expert and director of the union of concerned scientists' scientific integrity program . <end> <start> "the new rules weaken the scientific foundation of the endangered species act and make it easier to base decisions on politics instead of science . <end> <start> in giving the departments the authority to roll back these rules , congress has given the american people a gift , and the department secretaries need to open it .
